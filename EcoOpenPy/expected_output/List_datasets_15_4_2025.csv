This database was compiled by the authors of this study from both published and unpublished datasets resulting from their own work and an independent literature survey (Table S1, Supporting Information). This database is available as part of the Fine-Root Ecology Database (FRED; http://roots.ornl.gov; Iversen et al. 2017), released in March 2017. With respect to plant functional types, species were sorted into four main growth forms (Graminoids, Forbs, Shrubs and Trees) and N2-fixation ability (able/not able to fix atmospheric N2), which were established based on the information provided in the
TRY database (https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php). In the case of species not referenced in TRY, information was retrieved from alternative sources (Tela Botanica 2015; USDA NRCS 2015). Owing to gaps in locally measured climate data, we used climate data available from the Worldclim database (Hijmans et al. 2005) to represent common-garden and field observations. Common-garden and field observations were therefore linked to soil properties as found in the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-CAS/JRC 2012) based on their geographic coordinates. A phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. S1) using the comprehen- sive Angiosperm species-level phylogeny from Zanne et al. (2014), as updated by Qian & Jin (2015). The list and content of datasets used in this study is available in Table S1. These datasets are available as part of the Fine-Root Ecology Database (FRED;
