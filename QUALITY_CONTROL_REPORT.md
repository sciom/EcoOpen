## Code Quality Metrics

### Before QC
- Test Coverage: 0%
- Linting Errors: Unknown (no linter configured)
- Security Issues: Multiple critical issues
- Documentation: Minimal
- Type Hints: Partial (~50%)
- Exception Handling: Poor (19 bare exceptions)

### After QC
- Test Coverage: Basic infrastructure in place (ready for expansion)
- Linting Errors: Configuration in place (flake8, black, isort)
- Security Issues: All critical issues resolved
- Documentation: Comprehensive (README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, docstrings)
- Type Hints: Improved (added to new code, existing ~50%)
- Exception Handling: Good (specific exception types, proper logging)

---

## Test Coverage

### Current Test Files
- `test_config.py` - Configuration and settings validation (8 tests)
- `test_schemas.py` - Data model validation (6 tests)
- `test_validation.py` - Input validation and sanitization (7 tests)
- `test_api.py` - Basic API structure tests (2 tests, requires mocking)

### Test Categories
- ✅ Unit tests: Configuration, schemas, validation
- ⚠️ Integration tests: Require MongoDB/Ollama mocking
- ⚠️ E2E tests: Not yet implemented

**Recommendation**: Add integration tests with proper mocking in future sprints.

---

## Security Improvements

### Input Validation
- ✅ DOI validation with regex patterns
- ✅ URL validation to prevent malicious links
- ✅ Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal
- ✅ File extension validation
- ✅ File size limits enforced

### Configuration Security
- ✅ Environment variables for all secrets
- ✅ .env excluded from version control
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in code
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Security policy documented

### Error Handling
- ✅ Specific exception types instead of bare exceptions
- ✅ Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- ✅ Proper logging for debugging without leaking data

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Runs on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- ✅ Linting with flake8
- ✅ Code formatting checks with black
- ✅ Import sorting checks with isort
- ✅ Unit test execution
- ✅ Coverage reporting
- ✅ Frontend build verification

### Pre-commit Hooks

- ✅ Black formatting
- ✅ Import sorting
- ✅ Flake8 linting

---

## Deployment Options

### Docker (New)

- ✅ Health checks configured
- ✅ Environment variable support
- ✅ Volume mounts for persistence

### Manual (Existing)
- ✅ Shell scripts (run_api.sh, setup_conda.sh)
- ✅ Virtual environment support
- ✅ Requirements files

## Recommendations for Future Work

### High Priority
1. **Integration Tests**: Add tests that mock MongoDB and Ollama
2. **API Documentation**: Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse
4. **Logging**: Enhance structured logging for production monitoring

### Medium Priority
1. **Type Hints**: Complete type hints for all functions
2. **Performance**: Add performance profiling and optimization
3. **Database Migrations**: Add Alembic or similar for schema migrations
4. **API Versioning**: Implement /v1/ API versioning

### Low Priority
1. **Frontend Tests**: Add Vue component tests
2. **Load Testing**: Add performance testing suite
3. **Metrics**: Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
4. **Documentation**: Add architecture diagrams
