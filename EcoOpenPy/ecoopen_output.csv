We provided observers with data sheets and asked them to record all sightings of marked blackcaps. We considered blackcaps to be confidently categorized as wintering individuals (as op-posed to early or late migrants passing through) if they were encoun-tered between 1 December and 1 March, defining these boundaries using ringing recovery data (Figure S1). In total, we com-piled a dataset of 9929 records of 623 color-ringed blackcaps, of which 357 were encountered one or more times after initial capture.2.2  |  MorphometricsWe measured blackcaps during ringing using wing and tail rules and analog calipers. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License2718 |   VAN DOREN et al.2.3  |  Daily weatherWe obtained local weather station data from the Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS; Met Office, 2012; http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/220a65615218d5c9cc9e4785a3234bd0). We in-cluded only data from individuals categorized as wintering in Britain (see above). For analysis, we retained data from a given site in a given winter if there were blackcap observations from at least 30 days in that winter. We simplified the model by removing non-significant interactions (p > 0.05).Our dataset comprised daily encounters compiled from dozens of observers, but we lacked observation effort data with which to infer zero counts for days with no marked birds reported. Therefore, our count dataset lacked zero counts, which are expected with a Poisson distribution family. We leveraged our extensive dataset of individual observations to model the probability of individual blackcaps visiting garden feeding sites through the winter. In total, the dataset had 6104 positive observations and 10,982 inferred negative observations.First, we used a generalized mixed-effects model with a bino-mial distribution and logit link function to model the probability of an individual being detected in a garden on a particular day. We fit the model with bam (a version of gam for large datasets). We spec-ified random effects of year, location, and individual to account for differences in the average probability of blackcap detection across years, sites, and individuals.We next focused on testing for relationships between garden visitation and morphology and body condition, restricting the anal-ysis to data from individuals that had been captured and measured at least once during the winter of observation. This reduced our dataset from 6104 positive observations of 225 individuals to 2777 positive observations of 90 individuals. For each individual, we determined whether or not it subsequently returned to the same site, consider-ing data from up to three winters following initial ringing. We only retained data points for sites where we had visual observation data for subsequent winters (N  =  324 individuals across 17 sites). We also included a fixed effect describing the number of years of observa-tion data available to account for differences in the number of re-sighting opportunities. As above, we used the rptR package.2.7  |  TransienceOur dataset included a large number of blackcaps that were encoun-tered only briefly each year. We modeled the likelihood of transience in our dataset with a binary variable of whether each individual bird was encountered for more than 1 week in a year. We obtained ringing data from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Ringing Scheme for Britain and Ireland. For resight data, we categorized blackcaps as British Isles winterers if they were encountered between 1 December and 1 March (Figure S1).Given the evidence for transient individuals among wintering blackcaps visiting gardens, we used ringing data to study move-ments undertaken by individuals within the same winter. We fil-tered ringing data to individuals we were confident were wintering in Britain and Ireland (see above), but we considered all recoveries between 1 November and 1 April to understand how these in-dividuals moved both early and late in the season. We also used ringing data to examine movements between winters, filtering the dataset to encounters that occurred between 1 December and 1 March.We combined ringing data with tracks from light-level geoloca-tors (Figure 1c) to identify where blackcaps wintering in Britain and Ireland spend the summer. Geolocator data were from Delmore et al. Unsurprisingly, individual identity explained more vari-ation in the dataset (0.13, 95% CI [0.08, 0.16]) than location (0.05 [0, 0.12]) or year (0.04 [0.02, 0.07]).We documented relationships between garden visitation rate and sex, body condition, morphology, and weather. Our first model, which incorporated all individuals but lacked body con-dition and morphology data, revealed strong relationships with air temperature, precipitation, and winds.

Ringing data showed that between-winter movements averaged 148 km ± 309 SD (Figure 4b). Our detailed garden sight-ing data showed that even individuals established in a garden in one winter may spend the following winter far from the initial site. The following winter, it did not return to this site, but was present (and pho-tographed) at a garden 53 km away between 7 January and 12 February 2019.3.6  |  Breeding areas and migrationCombining ringing recoveries and geolocator data, we observe that blackcaps wintering in Britain and Ireland occupy a wide breeding area, spanning 2000 km across Europe (Figure 4d). Circles show ringing recoveries and crosses show geolocator data from Delmore et al. An ad-ditional six recoveries occurred within Britain and Ireland, suggesting some individuals may be year-round residents (though see Section 4).Geolocator data indicated that British winterers departed on spring migration between 15 March and 26 April, with a median date of 2 April (Figure 5a). Truly harsh weather events (e.g., with snow cover or pro-longed freezing conditions) were rare in our dataset. In addition, 79.8% of our analyzed data come from the gardens of authors GCMR and GCE, who provided a constant food supply. (2007), as their data came from captures and ours pri-marily from visual resightings with variable effort; future work on blackcap garden behavior would benefit from more standardized observation effort and individual tracking data (e.g., via radio telem-etry). Thus, garden feeding stations may have a disproportion-ate positive effect on survival.4.4  |  Individual variation and flexibilityLarge individual variation was a defining feature of our dataset. Regardless, our results show that black-caps exhibit a great deal of variation and flexibility in their strate-gies, which may be a key to their success as environments rapidly change.4.5  |  Breeding origins of British winterers and evidence for residencyWe combined ringing recoveries and individual tracking data to show that blackcaps wintering in Britain originate from a 2000 km wide swath of Europe (Delmore et al., 2020). Ringing recoveries alone supported central European origins of the wintering popula-tion, but tracking data show that the breeding range extends well into southwest Europe, even to the Iberian Peninsula, and farther east than suggested from ringing recoveries.There were six recoveries of individuals encountered in Britain and Ireland during both summer and winter, suggesting limited year-round residency. Moreover, our individual-level data reveal the tremendous individual flexibility that blackcaps exhibit in their movement patterns and responses to conditions.

Wild pigs are abundant throughout the entire SRS (Mayer, Beasley, et al., 2020), with an es-timated population size of >5000 individuals at the time of this study (Keiter et al., 2017).2.2  |  Data collectionWe sampled from live-trapped (and consequently released for other studies, e.g., neonate survival (Chinn et al.,  2021)) and humanely euthanized wild pigs throughout the year between March 2017 and July 2019 according to established protocols (A2015 12-017). We collected fetal data, tissue for genetic analysis, and morphological FI G U R E 1 Wild pig (Sus scrofa) mature female, juveniles, and piglets on the Savannah River Site, Aiken, SC, USA. Given that association with wild boar and heritage breeds represented the vast majority of the ances-tral composition of the SRS population, we included only wild boar ancestry as a variable in subsequent analyses.2.3  |  Data analysisTo confirm rump fat was a suitable proxy for resource availability, we tested whether increased acorn mast production in 2017 resulted in greater rump fat depth compared with the other years of our study using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. We used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) and model weights to determine which candidate models provided the best support for the data. While management of wild pig populations, including the SRS population, is largely un-biased for sex, demographic fluctuations in localized populations may influence litter sex ratio.For other ungulates, maternal age influences offspring sex ratio (Côté & Festa-Bianchet, 2001; Saltz, 2001; Thomas et al., 1989; but see Hamel et al., 2016, where the trend disappeared with a larger dataset which can be a limiting factor in wildlife studies) and it is found to influence reproductive ecology in wild pigs such that older females contribute most to population growth (Chinn et al.,  2022).

In these fields, mostly molecular differences are used for species delimitation, sometimes combined with morpho-logical and/or ecological data in an integrative taxonomy approach (Schlick-Steiner et al., 2010). Likewise, the BIN system used by the BOLD database uses a 2.2% threshold of COI difference (Ratnasing-ham & Hebert, 2013). This agrees with other data on reproductive barriers in L. Therefore, we suggest using data on reproductive isolation from crossing experiments with suitable candidate species for calibration to determine taxon-specific thresholds that can then be used for species delimitation. Thereby, we should be able to rec-oncile the BSC, which is employed by most scientists studying ecol-ogy and evolution, and the species concepts based on molecular and morphological data, which are used by most taxonomists for species delimitation and species description.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSMarie Pollmann: Conceptualization (equal); data curation (lead); formal analysis (lead); funding acquisition (equal); investigation (lead); methodology (equal); project administration (supporting); supervision (equal); validation (equal); visualization (lead); writing – original draft (lead); writing – review and editing (lead).

Thereby, species are often separated based on the divergence of the barcode segment (Hajibabaei et al.,  2006; Hebert et al.,  2004; Smith et al.,  2005, 2006; Ward et al., 2005), that is, a gap between intraspecific variance and inter-specific distance, referred to as barcode gap (Hebert et al., 2004; Meyer & Paulay,  2005). Although different methods have been suggested to set the threshold for the barcode gap (e.g. In extreme cases, up to hundreds of presumed new species were described largely based on barcodes, which has been termed turbo-taxonomy (Butcher et al., 2012; Meierotto et al., 2019; Sharkey et al., 2021).Comparing this method of species delimitation to the results of our crossing experiments with L. distinguendus reveals that the strictly set thresholds commonly used for species delimitation based on barcodes, specifically thresholds of 2% or 2.2% COI di-vergence (Fagan-Jeffries et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2017; Meierotto et al., 2019; Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2013; Sharkey et al., 2021; Smith et al.,  2013) do not match the species limits determined based on the BSC.

Based on these prior morphological observations, the broad distribution of the species and the differences in environmental conditions among tea-growing regions, we hypothesized that these morphological variations reflect genetic differences among geographic populations.Previous studies of the population structure and genetic dif-ferentiation of tea green leafhopper have used mitochondrial gene sequence data or limited numbers of microsatellite markers (Chen et al., 2015; Fu, Li, et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016, 2019; Zhang et al.,  2018; Zhou et al.,  2014; Zhu et al.,  2019). Microsatellite-based results revealed some geographical differen-tiation between populations, particularly between two populations in Yunnan and the other Chinese populations but provided only limited evidence of consistent population genetic structure, poten-tially affected by endogenous properties of the markers used (e.g., fluctuations in allele frequency and recombination rates), the quality of genetic data and the sampling methods. For the present study, we obtained more extensive data using next-generation sequenc-ing (NGS) to more fully characterize the genetic substructure in M. All the genotypic data conversions were performed with GenALEx v. onukii populations was estimated by poste-rior probability of the data (L (K)) and the ad hoc statistic (ΔK) using the Web server Clumpak was used to align results from replicate analyses and visualize population structure (Evanno et al.,  2005; Kopelman et al., 2015; Pritchard et al., 2000; Pritchard et al., 2010).

The optimal K for the SNP data in-ferred from FASTStructure ranged from 1 to 18 (Figure 4b), and the lowest cross-validation error (CV) was obtained for K = 3. Both datasets indicate that six populations of M. onukii from the Southwest tea produc-tion area in China are significantly differentiated from populations in all other sites, particularly populations in Japan (Figure S4).3.5  |  Isolation by distance analysisThe traditional Mantel test identified significant geographic dif-ferentiation among 18 populations in both marker datasets (SNPs: RXY = .461, p < .001; SSR: RXY = .426, p < .000) (Figure S5). When SX population or CT/CY/ZY populations were included in Cluster 3–1 based on the results by SNP dataset, obvious asymmet-ric migration was also detected (Figure S7).4  |  DISCUSSIONAccurate assessment of genetic structure is a major aim of pest molecular ecology, as it can reveal patterns of association among  20457758, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.9377 by Cochrane Croatia, Wiley Online Library on [23/06/2025]. Our SNP dataset confirmed some genetic structural patterns in M. Similarly, the CT, CY, ZY, and SX populations were clus-tered with Cluster 4–1 and Cluster 4–3 based on microsatellite data (Figure 3c,d), while they were clustered with JH, YD, GL, FZ, HQ, and VN populations in Cluster 3–1 by the SNPs data (Figure 4a,b).Our results imply that different mutation rates of the two types of markers might reflect different stages of population evolutionary history, which can lead to differences in estimated population struc-ture. onukii reference genome (ASM1883171v1) in Genome Warehouse may allow for finer-scale analysis of gene flow among populations (Malinsky et al., 2021; Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012).5  |  CONCLUSIONRecent advances in sequencing technologies can provide genomic data for accurately identifying patterns of genetic structure with effective samples.

Next, we annotated theregions of the Aiptasia genome encoding noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs),including snoRNAs, snRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAs using referencencRNA sequences retrieved from the RNAcentral database (TheRNAcentral Consortium, 2015) and aligned to the Aiptasia genomeusing BLASTN (E-value cut-off ≤1e-5) (Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers,& Lipman, 1990). The Aiptasia ncRNA regions identified by this align-ment were then used as a database for mapping of the small RNAreads using bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012). Small RNA readsthat mapped to the ncRNA database using bowtie2 were removedbefore further analyses.miRNAs were then annotated using the miRDeep2 package withdefault settings (Friedlander et al., 2012). Briefly, pyico-clip calculates the background frequency of detected CLIP-tag peaksby randomly placing the same number of CLIP-tags into exonic regionsand calculating the probability of obtaining the same CLIP-tag peakheight as from the actual data. When a CLIP-tag peakregion was targeted by multiple miRNAs, we only retained the interac-tion that showed the highest number of binding nucleotides betweenthe miRNA and the CLIP-tag peak region.For comparison of miRNA–mRNA complementarity between Aip-tasia and published mammalian CLIP data sets, we retrieved thehuman miRNA CLIP data that were initially sampled by Kishore et al.(2011) and reanalysed by Grosswendt et al.

(d) Overlap of evolutionarily conserved mature miRNAs in the anthozoans for whichdata are available; the numbers of conserved and distinct species are indicated. (f) Frequencies (%) of miRNA–mRNA interactions with variousnumbers of miRNA nucleotides involved in mRNA target binding (blue area: Aiptasia CLIP data [this study]; grey area: Human CLIP data;Grosswendt et al., 2014; Kishore et al., 2011, left-hand axis). The average minimum free energy of binding for each of the miRNA–mRNAinteractions in the Aiptasia data is shown as orange diamonds (right-hand axis). In contrast, many ofthe interactions identified here seemed to include a much highernumber of binding nucleotides from the miRNA, especially whendirectly compared to human CLIP data (Grosswendt et al., 2014;Kishore et al., 2011) (Figure 3f). This interpretation is consistent with the generally largehybridization length of the miRNA–mRNA duplex (i.e., the number ofmiRNA nucleotides involved in mRNA-target binding) observed inour CLIP data, in particular when compared to human miRNA–mRNAinteractions. Eventhough we did not find previously identified Symbiodinium miRNAsor sRNAs that were bound to AipAgo1 in the experiments describedhere, a similar mechanism was recently hypothesized to function alsoin the coral–Symbiodinium endosymbiosis (Baumgarten et al., 2013;Lin et al., 2015).Taken together, our data suggest that miRNAs are involved notonly in defining the susceptibility of host organisms to endopara-sites (Ghosh et al., 2013; LaMonte et al., 2012; Weiberg et al.,2014) but also in post-transcriptional modulations of gene expres-sion that might be important in mutualistic relationships such asthe dinoflagellate endosymbiosis in anemones and corals.

In this context, we also identified miRNA-interactingmRNAs that encode proteins that are likely to be involved in themaintenance of the symbiosome, including a homolog of LAMP1, aprotein related to lysosome—and potentially symbiosome—traffick-ing and maturation (Mohamed et al., 2016); a homolog of the steroltransporter NPC1 (Dani et al., 2014, 2017; Ganot et al., 2011; Lehn-ert et al., 2014); and a homolog of the peptide transporter ABCB9(Davy et al., 2012).

Finally, discussion on the distribution of several morphological char-acters in the phylogeny and their taxonomic relevance is also provided, with views on the need for a new generic delimitation.Keywords  Achyrocline; allopolyploidy; Anaphalis; ETS; hybridisation; Helichrysum; Humeocline; ITS; ndhF; paraphyly; Pseudognaphalium; reticulate evolution; rpl32-trnL intergenic spacerSupplementary Material  The Electronic Supplement (Table S1, Appendix S1) and alignments are available in the Supplementary Data section of the online version of this article at http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax609Galbany-Casals & al. This character probably explains why its affinities with Helichrysum were not suspected before molecular data were available, although some Anaphalis species do resemble some Asian Helichrysum in their gross morphology. In the ETS, rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer and ndhF datasets, ambiguous regions in alignments were de-tected and excluded by the use of Gblocks v.0.91 (Castresana, 2000; Talavera & Castresana, 2007). This software allows the automatic, objective and repeatable detection and elimination from the dataset of those parts that cannot be unambiguously aligned. Final aligned length analysed for each region is shown in Table 1, with indica-tion of the percentage of the original datasets that it represents after the exclusion of ambiguously aligned regions. Data ma-trices are available on request from the corresponding author.Analyses. The nrDNA sequences were analysed at two levels using two different datasets. The tribe nrDNA dataset comprised all species included in this study and used the same three members of the Relhania clade as outgroup taxa. This dataset was composed of the ITS region and a conserved 3′ portion of the ETS, which corresponds to the fragment ampli-fied by the Ast-1 and 18S-ETS primers (Markos & Baldwin, 2001). The second nrDNA dataset—the HAP clade dataset—included taxa selected from results of the tribe nrDNA dataset analyses. This dataset was com-posed of the ITS region and a longer portion of the ETS, which corresponds to the fragment amplified by the ETS1f (Linder & al., 2000) and 18S-ETS (Markos & Baldwin, 2001) primers, and provided better results in resolving phylogenetic relation-ships within the HAP clade due to the possibility of aligning a longer portion, and therefore analysing a larger number of characters from the ETS region.Bayesian inference (BI) of phylogeny was conducted using MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003).

For some particular clades, and with the additional evidence from low-copy markers and chromosome data, an allopolyploid origin has been hypothesised (Smissen & al., 2011). The data presented here are generally consistent with an allopolyploid origin of some clades within the HAP clade, although the scenarios presented by Smissen & al. Although the exact number of allopolyploidy events that would have led to clade B1 and Anaphalis is not certain with the present data, some hypotheses can be presented about possible parental species involved. nicolai would be of homoploid hybrid origin, although the present data are not conclusive.In the present work, many other cases of incongruence have been detected between nrDNA and cpDNA trees (Figs. Although evidence is scarce at the moment, these data could also be interpreted as suggesting a possible polyploid origin of Achyrocline in Africa, and a subsequent dispersal to the New World. Our pres-ent data suggest that several lineages would have originated in eastern tropical Africa and would have dispersed out of Africa and diversified elsewhere. Splitting Helichrysum into a number of genera would be consistent with other taxonomic progress in the tribe (see Ward & al., 2009), but given the current lack of phylogenetic resolution among many of the species, much further work would be required before new genera could be proposed as monophyletic.Given the uncertainty and complexity of phylogenetic re-lationships within the HAP clade suggested by DNA sequence data, morphological characters need to be given particular at-tention. With the present data this feature seems to be diagnostic for the HAP clade, although future stud-ies should consider other Helichrysum species with undivided stereomes, together with a more comprehensive sampling of Anaxeton and Syncarpha.Characters related to capitulum sex ratio show interesting patterns in the phylogenies. Although the HAP clade is well defined and highly supported, the complexity of phylogenetic relationships and morphological variation among its species implies that a de-cision on generic delimitation would be premature with the present data.
