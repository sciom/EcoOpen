Data for the four fine-root traits used in this study were extracted from the Rhizopolis database. This database was compiled by the authors of this study from both published and unpublished datasets resulting from their own work and an independent literature survey (Table S1, Supporting Information). This database is available as part of the Fine-Root Ecology Database (FRED; http://roots.ornl.gov; Iversen et al. 2017), released in March 2017. With respect to plant functional types, species were sorted into four main growth forms (Graminoids, Forbs, Shrubs and Trees) and N2-fixation ability (able/not able to fix atmospheric N2), which were established based on the information provided in the TRY database (https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php). In the case of species not referenced in TRY, information was retrieved from alternative sources (Tela Botanica 2015; USDA NRCS 2015). Owing to gaps in locally measured climate data, we used climate data available from the Worldclim database (Hijmans et al. 2005) to represent common-garden and field observations. Common-garden and field observations were therefore linked to soil properties as found in the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-CAS/JRC 2012) based on their geographic coordinates. A phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. S1) using the comprehen- sive Angiosperm species-level phylogeny from Zanne et al. (2014), as updated by Qian & Jin (2015). The list and content of datasets used in this study is available in Table S1. These datasets are available as part of the Fine-Root Ecology Database (FRED; http://roots.ornl.gov).

To examine whether multiple matrix regression analysis could measure IBD and IBE in natural systems, I used it to analyze a set of previously published, real world datasets (Robertsonet al. 2009; Wang and Summers 2010; Wang 2012); I first acquired GIS data layers for 23 environmental variables, including 19 bioclimatic variables with 1-km resolution from the WorldClim database (bio1–19; http://www.bioclim.org) and four vegetation variables from the MODIS landcover database with 250-m resolution (LAI, leaf area index; NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index; tree density; and herbaceous density; http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

We use three sources of data that for many countries are already in the public domain: governmental agricultural statistics, which provide a quantitative assessment of farming intensity in the ‘working landscape’, data on threat status and species distribution for plants and butterflies from conservation agencies and similar bodies and functional traits of plant species abstracted from published data bases. It would not have been possible without access to data holdings of the Botanical Society of the British Isles (Preston, Pearman & Dines 2002a) and the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA 2006), both in the public domain. Distributional data on butterflies came from the Butterflies for the New Millennium recording scheme (Asher et al. 2001), courtesy of Butterfly Conservation, and were provided in electronic form by Richard Fox (Butterfly Conservation). The only ‘private’ data, our leaf measurements, are freely available, as they are now incorporated within the TRY data base (Kattge et al. 2011).

Among the 3000 vascular plants occurring naturally in Switzerland (Aeschimann and Burdet 1994; Lauber and Wagner 2007), 104 native species are making part of the ecological group of aquatic macrophytes following the classification of the Swiss flora of Moser et al. (2002) (Appendix S1).; Our survey shows that 87 native aquatic plant species were found in all four of the investigated urban areas at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century (Fig. 3, Appendix S1). 
Available survivorship data (Table A.1 in Appendix A) for the Asian elephant (Sukumar, 1989; Sukumar et al., 1998) and for the African elephant (Moss, 2001; Amboseli Trust for Elephants, 2012) were used in the simulations.; Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.05.008.
Content- We constructed a survey of 30 Likert questions divided among 5 topical areas (Online Resource 1); We received a total of 699 comments from all 30 survey questions (Online Resource 3).; We analyzed comments for questions that showed a significant difference in level of agreement among groups (9 questions, Figs. 3–5; Online Resource, 4) or that generated a large amount of feedback (specifically questions 5 and 30). Ultimately, we derived 51 comment theme groupings (Online Resource 2) from a total of 306 comments associated with these 11 questions.
