As a consequence, the mostparsimonious matK tree is only scarcely resolved.Therefore, we decided to exclude these data.Accordingly, we selected a marker which has beendemonstrated to be more variable and useful at thespecific level in other plant taxa, the ITS regionof the nrDNA. For details and areview of karyology of Asclepiadoideae see Albersand Meve (2001).Data analysis. The selected optimalmodel of sequence evolution for the nrITSdataset was the SYM+I+G model (Zharkikh1994): equal base frequencies, a rate matrixwith rAC = 0.9042, rAG = 2.3612, rAT =1.0916, rCG = 0.3085, rCT = 4.9914, aproportion of invariable sites of 0.4307 and agamma shape of 0.6563. The nrITS data setrevealed two weakly supported major lineages.Clade A includes Echidnopsis montana, E.malum, E. This contrasts the results of Meve andLiede (2002), who showed Echidnopsis to bemonophyleticandsistertoRhytidocaulonbased on nrITS data, but without consideringspecies of Clade A.

Finally, discussion on the distribution of several morphological char-acters in the phylogeny and their taxonomic relevance is also provided, with views on the need for a new generic delimitation.Keywords  Achyrocline; allopolyploidy; Anaphalis; ETS; hybridisation; Helichrysum; Humeocline; ITS; ndhF; paraphyly; Pseudognaphalium; reticulate evolution; rpl32-trnL intergenic spacerSupplementary Material  The Electronic Supplement (Table S1, Appendix S1) and alignments are available in the Supplementary Data section of the online version of this article at http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax609Galbany-Casals & al. This character probably explains why its affinities with Helichrysum were not suspected before molecular data were available, although some Anaphalis species do resemble some Asian Helichrysum in their gross morphology. In the ETS, rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer and ndhF datasets, ambiguous regions in alignments were de-tected and excluded by the use of Gblocks v.0.91 (Castresana, 2000; Talavera & Castresana, 2007). This software allows the automatic, objective and repeatable detection and elimination from the dataset of those parts that cannot be unambiguously aligned. Final aligned length analysed for each region is shown in Table 1, with indica-tion of the percentage of the original datasets that it represents after the exclusion of ambiguously aligned regions. Data ma-trices are available on request from the corresponding author.Analyses. The nrDNA sequences were analysed at two levels using two different datasets. The tribe nrDNA dataset comprised all species included in this study and used the same three members of the Relhania clade as outgroup taxa. This dataset was composed of the ITS region and a conserved 3′ portion of the ETS, which corresponds to the fragment ampli-fied by the Ast-1 and 18S-ETS primers (Markos & Baldwin, 2001). The second nrDNA dataset—the HAP clade dataset—included taxa selected from results of the tribe nrDNA dataset analyses. This dataset was com-posed of the ITS region and a longer portion of the ETS, which corresponds to the fragment amplified by the ETS1f (Linder & al., 2000) and 18S-ETS (Markos & Baldwin, 2001) primers, and provided better results in resolving phylogenetic relation-ships within the HAP clade due to the possibility of aligning a longer portion, and therefore analysing a larger number of characters from the ETS region.Bayesian inference (BI) of phylogeny was conducted using MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003).

For some particular clades, and with the additional evidence from low-copy markers and chromosome data, an allopolyploid origin has been hypothesised (Smissen & al., 2011). The data presented here are generally consistent with an allopolyploid origin of some clades within the HAP clade, although the scenarios presented by Smissen & al. Although the exact number of allopolyploidy events that would have led to clade B1 and Anaphalis is not certain with the present data, some hypotheses can be presented about possible parental species involved. nicolai would be of homoploid hybrid origin, although the present data are not conclusive.In the present work, many other cases of incongruence have been detected between nrDNA and cpDNA trees (Figs. Although evidence is scarce at the moment, these data could also be interpreted as suggesting a possible polyploid origin of Achyrocline in Africa, and a subsequent dispersal to the New World. Our pres-ent data suggest that several lineages would have originated in eastern tropical Africa and would have dispersed out of Africa and diversified elsewhere. Splitting Helichrysum into a number of genera would be consistent with other taxonomic progress in the tribe (see Ward & al., 2009), but given the current lack of phylogenetic resolution among many of the species, much further work would be required before new genera could be proposed as monophyletic.Given the uncertainty and complexity of phylogenetic re-lationships within the HAP clade suggested by DNA sequence data, morphological characters need to be given particular at-tention. With the present data this feature seems to be diagnostic for the HAP clade, although future stud-ies should consider other Helichrysum species with undivided stereomes, together with a more comprehensive sampling of Anaxeton and Syncarpha.Characters related to capitulum sex ratio show interesting patterns in the phylogenies. Although the HAP clade is well defined and highly supported, the complexity of phylogenetic relationships and morphological variation among its species implies that a de-cision on generic delimitation would be premature with the present data. Available data on low-copy DNA markers (Smissen & al., 2011) showed more structure in the phylogenies obtained.

Wild pigs are abundant throughout the entire SRS (Mayer, Beasley, et al., 2020), with an es-timated population size of >5000 individuals at the time of this study (Keiter et al., 2017).2.2  |  Data collectionWe sampled from live-trapped (and consequently released for other studies, e.g., neonate survival (Chinn et al.,  2021)) and humanely euthanized wild pigs throughout the year between March 2017 and July 2019 according to established protocols (A2015 12-017).

Given that association with wild boar and heritage breeds represented the vast majority of the ances-tral composition of the SRS population, we included only wild boar ancestry as a variable in subsequent analyses.2.3  |  Data analysisTo confirm rump fat was a suitable proxy for resource availability, we tested whether increased acorn mast production in 2017 resulted in greater rump fat depth compared with the other years of our study using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. We used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) and model weights to determine which candidate models provided the best support for the data. While management of wild pig populations, including the SRS population, is largely un-biased for sex, demographic fluctuations in localized populations may influence litter sex ratio.For other ungulates, maternal age influences offspring sex ratio (Côté & Festa-Bianchet, 2001; Saltz, 2001; Thomas et al., 1989; but see Hamel et al., 2016, where the trend disappeared with a larger dataset which can be a limiting factor in wildlife studies) and it is found to influence reproductive ecology in wild pigs such that older females contribute most to population growth (Chinn et al.,  2022).

This first inductive step of analysis yieldeda coherent assessment of each participant’s cognitive and affectual responses with regardto their relation to the model animal, and to how this relation is embedded within theirpersonal background and lifeways.In a second inductive step, we coded for themes and patterns that recurred acrossparticipants within and across sub-samples.

In these fields, mostly molecular differences are used for species delimitation, sometimes combined with morpho-logical and/or ecological data in an integrative taxonomy approach (Schlick-Steiner et al., 2010). Likewise, the BIN system used by the BOLD database uses a 2.2% threshold of COI difference (Ratnasing-ham & Hebert, 2013). This agrees with other data on reproductive barriers in L. Therefore, we suggest using data on reproductive isolation from crossing experiments with suitable candidate species for calibration to determine taxon-specific thresholds that can then be used for species delimitation. Thereby, we should be able to rec-oncile the BSC, which is employed by most scientists studying ecol-ogy and evolution, and the species concepts based on molecular and morphological data, which are used by most taxonomists for species delimitation and species description.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSMarie Pollmann: Conceptualization (equal); data curation (lead); formal analysis (lead); funding acquisition (equal); investigation (lead); methodology (equal); project administration (supporting); supervision (equal); validation (equal); visualization (lead); writing – original draft (lead); writing – review and editing (lead).

Thereby, species are often separated based on the divergence of the barcode segment (Hajibabaei et al.,  2006; Hebert et al.,  2004; Smith et al.,  2005, 2006; Ward et al., 2005), that is, a gap between intraspecific variance and inter-specific distance, referred to as barcode gap (Hebert et al., 2004; Meyer & Paulay,  2005). Although different methods have been suggested to set the threshold for the barcode gap (e.g. In extreme cases, up to hundreds of presumed new species were described largely based on barcodes, which has been termed turbo-taxonomy (Butcher et al., 2012; Meierotto et al., 2019; Sharkey et al., 2021).Comparing this method of species delimitation to the results of our crossing experiments with L. distinguendus reveals that the strictly set thresholds commonly used for species delimitation based on barcodes, specifically thresholds of 2% or 2.2% COI di-vergence (Fagan-Jeffries et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2017; Meierotto et al., 2019; Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2013; Sharkey et al., 2021; Smith et al.,  2013) do not match the species limits determined based on the BSC.

Some regionalcouncils now classify RES as pests in the wild and advocatefurther research to determine whether this species poses athreat to New Zealand’s environment (Auckland RegionalCouncil, 2007; Greater Wellington Regional Council, 2007).The aim of this paper is to provide a predictive model foran invasive species worldwide, and to use these data toestimate probabilities of establishment of that invasivespecies across a case-study region. We aim to: (1) predict areas ofsuitable RES habitat globally with a model chosen for itslow false-negative and high true-positive prediction rate; (2)use the global data to predict areas in New Zealand that aresusceptible to RES establishment; (3) provide both conser-vative (best-case scenario) and liberal (worst-case scenario)predictions to be made based on knowledge of breedingstatus; (4) express all predictions on an intuitive scale that isindependent of the sample size and relative to the suitabilityacross the full range of known occurrences.MethodsData sourcesCurrent distribution records of RES presence were collectedfrom scientific publications, online database, and wildlifefield guides (supporting information Tables S1 and S2). If coordinates were not supplied, locations wereobtained using Google Earth (http://earth.google.com) andlatitude–longitude coordinates (WGS84) were acquired.Location records were assigned to two possible categories:(1) conservative dataset (records where RES have bredsuccessfully in native and introduced ranges), (2) liberaldataset (records from the conservative dataset plus RESsightings, but where breeding was not confirmed). juveniles found in the wild),they were placed in the liberal dataset.Global climate data for temperature and precipitationwereobtained from the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC) as an array of half-degree latitude longitude grid cells (New, Hulme & Jones, 1999). For cross-validation pur-poses the global dataset was partitioned into five geographicareas with a minimum of 10 positive occurrences in each: (1)Animal Conservation 13, Suppl. Eachmodel was run using three of these geographic areas as‘Training data’ (calibration) and the two remaining areas as‘Test data’ (evaluation). The coarse-scale geographic se-paration of the test and training data minimizes the chancesof identifying spurious relationships due to cross-correla-tions between spatially autocorrelated predictor variables(Lennon, 2000; Hartley et al., 2006). Every possible combi-nation of three training data groups and two test datagroups was fitted and evaluated. Our specific metric forquantifying predictive ability of the models was based onreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots of the test datacalculated using the ROCR package (Sing et al., 2004).To produce an ROC plot, the predicted probability ofoccurrence (a continuous value between 0 and 1) is con-verted into a binary prediction of presence or absence, usinga threshold value. The binary predictions are then cross-classified with the observed data and the proportion of truepositives (also referred to as ‘sensitivity’) is plotted againstthe proportion of false positives (‘1specificity’). the one withthe highest pAUC of the test data) out of the 10 possiblecombinations of the data partitions (Table 2). The scoreswere divided by 10 to convert them into model weights,which represent our relative belief in the predictive ability ofeach model (Burnham & Anderson, 2002).Final predictions were made from a multimodel weightedaverage fitted to the complete dataset of all known recordsand presumed absences. The predictions of the weighted modelaverage from both the conservative and the liberal datasetswere visualized as (1) climate envelopes in climate space; (2)as maps of predicated suitability; (3) as box plots ofsuitability for specified geographic regions of managementinterest. In each of the above visualizations, the predictedprobability of occurrence from the logistic regression (avalue from 0 to 1 that is sensitive to prevalence in the fittingdataset) was rescaled into a score of relative suitability thathas a more intuitive interpretation. Mapswere redrawn at a finer resolution (5-min resolution) forNew Zealand using data from WorldClim (Hijmans et al.,2005) in order to determine more precisely which areas ofNew Zealand may be climatically suitable for RES.ResultsThe conservative dataset had 191 locations of confirmedbreeding sites of RES (supporting information Table S1).Some sites were in the same terrestrial grid cell and were notcounted twice, meaning that 163 location records were usedin analyses. The liberal dataset contained 459 locationrecords (including the records from the conservative data-set) (supporting information Table S2). Again, only onerecord per terrestrial grid cell was used, resulting in 352location records.Based on the pAUC values of the test data partition,‘model l’ had the best predictive ability for the confirmedbreeding dataset, with a relative weighting of 0.4 (Table 2).For the liberal dataset, ‘model j’ was the best performingmodel, with a relative weighting of 0.3 (supporting informa-tion Table S3). For consistency, ‘model l’ was used togenerate a description of the RES climate envelope for bothdatasets (Fig. As expected, theglobal predictions for each dataset highlighted the species’native range in the south-eastern US as an area highlysuitable for RES. When utilizing the conservative dataset(confirmed breeding records), areas identified as the bestclimatic match (suitability of 0.5 or greater) occurred insouth-eastern China, northern India, southern Turkey,central Europe (especially along the eastern Adriatic coast)and South America (Uruguay and Argentina, near BuenosAires). Results obtained with the liberal dataset expandedFigure 2 Example of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plotplotting a true positive rate (sensitivity) against a false-positive rate(1specificity) with a threshold of 0.95.

With regard to the liberal dataset, the relative NewZealand suitability score was 0.822, meaning that in terms ofadult survival, the New Zealand environment is as suitableas at least 82% of the other locations from which free-livingRES have been recorded from across the world.Higher resolution, regional-scale predictions predictedthat areas in the northern portion of New Zealand’s NorthIsland would be more suitable as RES establishment sitesthan areas further south (Fig. When RES locationrecords where breeding status was unknown were incorpo-rated (liberal dataset), the model predicted a larger area ofsuitable habitat where RES could survive in New Zealand(supporting information Fig. With theliberal dataset (including potential non-breeding records),the mean annual temperature and climate variables relatingto winter minima (MINAVG and MINMIN) were mosthighly represented.In their native range, RES occupy a variety of habitats,suggestingthattheypossessabroadtoleranceofTable 2 Comparison of models from Table 1 using the conservative dataset (confirmed breeding red-eared slider (RES) Trachemys scriptaelegans recordsModelCross-validationaFinal fitbAUCpAUCModel weightcAUCpAUCNZ suitability scoreda0.8760.66700.9330.7430.101b0.8670.6410.10.9420.7890.080c0.8570.6370.10.9160.5970.117d0.8670.66200.9320.7340.193e0.7970.61300.8710.6520.058f0.8730.63900.9070.7240.997g0.8030.6300.10.8730.6510.338h0.8620.60600.8910.6370.986i0.8700.6880.10.9020.7270.997j0.8690.6560.20.9030.7081.000k0.8700.67300.9410.8190.156l0.8830.6420.40.9600.8360.144Weighted multi-model averageNANANA0.9580.8400.160aCross-validation indicates performance in predicting withheld, geographically separated, test data (mean of 10 partitions), pAUC=partial areaunder the curve measured where specificity Z0.95.bPerformance under self-validation, where all available data were used to make final predictions of suitability.cModel weights determined from the number of times models were selected as the best predictive model (i.e. the one with the highest pAUC ofthe test data).

(d) Bioclimatic predictionsfor areas of a suitable RES habitat, derived from a weighted multimodel applied to higher resolution climate data of New Zealand and utilizing theconservative dataset (confirmed breeding records). As it can be difficultto infer soil temperatures from air temperature data (Hart-ley & Lester, 2003), and given that the metabolic activity ofdeveloping eggs may raise the surrounding soil temperature(Burger, 1976), further research on potential nest tempera-tures in New Zealand is required.Previous attempts to model areas of climatic suitabilityfor RES at a regional scale have included additional vari-ables such as amount of solar radiation and ‘human foot-print’, a measure of human influence on the global surface(Ficetola et al., 2009). Nonetheless, climatematching provides an opportunity to assess a species’ estab-lishment potential (Thuiller et al., 2005).The use of the two datasets [‘Conservative’ (confirmedRES breeding) and ‘Liberal’ (unconfirmed RES breeding)]in this study allowed us to better visualize the potentialrange of RES. The conservative dataset may lead to predic-tions of potential range that are too conservative, andalthough the liberal dataset may overestimate the potentialbreeding range, the two datasets help to define the twoextremes of what might be possible.Choice of model metricsFrom a management perspective, the suitability of the mostvulnerable site within a region is a meaningful summary of aregion’s vulnerability to invasion, particularly against non-native species that are regularly released throughout theregion. The development of a suitability score thatis independent of the number of positive records in thedataset will also allow biosecurity managers to more easilycompare the invasion threat of multiple species, makingit possible to rank species in order of threat level and,therefore, guide management decisions and allocation ofresources.Many measures of classification performance are avail-able (Fielding & Bell, 1997), and different rationales forselecting specific classification thresholds (Liu et al., 2005).In a biosecurity context, false-negative predictions are morecostly than false-positives, as it is more costly to eradicate apest than to identify a species that may become a problem(Mack et al., 2000). See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseperformance in independent test data was the more reliablecriterion for model weighting. Multimodel inferences aremore robust to errors in model specification (Chatfield,1995; Marmion et al., 2009), and also allow a more mean-ingful assessment of uncertainty – which is crucial in riskassessment.Finally, global-scale data were used to parameterize themodels, but if finer scale climate data are available forparticular areas (e.g. Model uncertainty, data mining andstatistical interference.

While our data on  ̄edging success and ̄edgling quality suggest that asynchrony was mala-daptive (see also Amundsen & Slagsvold 1991a),this could be counterbalanced by higher survivalrates of parents attending asynchronous broods.Costs of high parental investment in Eurasian kes-trels are especially well documented, in terms ofincreased levels of haematozoan infections (Wiehn& KorpimaÈ ki 1998; Wiehn, KorpimaÈ ki & Pen 1999)and lowered survival (Daan, Deerenberg & Dijkstra1996; but see KorpimaÈ ki & Rita 1996), and it is pos-sible that parents of asynchronous broods may havehigher survival than parents of synchronous broods.Unfortunately, we cannot test this hypothesis forour experimental nests because the return rate ofbreedingadultsisverylow(KorpimaÈ ki1988;KorpimaÈ ki & Rita 1996).

Datawere compiled from sectoral sources and ministerial databases,as well as through local consultation with governmentauthorities and participatory analysis of remotely sensedimagery in each of Laos’s 148 districts (Hett et al. The complete LCI databasecontains 1797 records covering all land concession sectors, landdeals established or implemented between 1993-2017, and oneto many records for each deal or segment of deal. The LCIdatabase contains information about land deal characteristics,including deal size, year(s) of establishment and/orimplementation, location (provincial level), country of investororigin, intended use (i.e., agricultural product), stage ofoperation, investment (e.g., foreign, domestic, shareholder), andcontract type (e.g., concession, lease, contract farming).

Although the dataset effectivelydifferentiated various crops, the spatial resolution was too coarseto identify rotational and smallholder agriculture shifts. Inaddition, the dataset was centered around a single year (2013)except for the boom crops for which the time of change wasestimated in three-year blocks. The dataset created by theJapanese space agency (JAXA) for the Lao government was invector format. The dataset was divided by province (n = 17) andincluded 22 potential classes. Unfortunately, this dataset wasavailable for only 4 epochs spaced in 5-year increments (2000,2005, 2010, 2015). We attempted to fill the gap years using theJAXA dataset to train a classifier (e.g., support vector machine)and conduct land cover classification.

First, our study relied on survey data that aggregated household responses to the village-level and in some cases sampled only a subset of villages impacted by a land deal. All survey responses were reported in Form 4 of the QI database. Crop Type  Primary intended used reported for the land deal from the LCI database.";"Occurrence of iLUC was independently coded from and cross-referenced between forest-loss mapping and survey responses.Annual forest-loss mapping identified areas of new land-usechanges in villages impacted by land deals, and a quasi-experimentalmatching approach was used to investigate differences in iLUCamong villages impacted by land deals. Forest-loss outcomesobserved in the matching analysis were then interpreted through asmaller set of impacted villages for which survey data were available.Survey responses from villages impacted by land deals weresystematically coded for the types and extents of impacts,particularly income changes resulting from land deals and causallylinked to land-use trends and land deal characteristics withqualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Such a mixed methods approach was essential due to multipledatasets of different data types (e.g., remote sensing of forest lossquantities, coded survey responses), different geographic units (i.e.,land deal boundaries, village area boundaries), and incompleteinformation (e.g., establishment and/or implementation datesEcology and Society 27(4): 7https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol27/iss4/art7/Fig. Survey response variables coded for the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Land deals were included only if surveyresponses were reported in at least one impacted village for eachof the coded variables in Table 2. Additionally, for land dealswith no reported establishment or implementation date in LCI,we estimated implementation year based on first visible land-usechange within 500-meter buffered land deal boundaries usingvisual interpretation of Google Earth Pro Time Lapse imagery.Village survey responses were coded and assigned to specific landdeals using the codebook and procedure listed in Appendix 1,Table A1.3. Toavoid this issue, some coded survey responses were aggregated tocreate composite causal variables for use in the QCA. Instances ofdispossession or displacement were combined into a single“Displacement” variable in which the occurrence of either wascoded as “present.” Employment and compensation werecombined into a “Financial” variable with three levels of none,either, or both constituent variables present. Outcomes of poverty reduction and iLUC were also coded fromthe survey data. The presence or absence ofiLUC was coded based on survey responses related to bringing newor previously fallowed land into production (Appendix 1, TableA1.3 for details). These coded responses were compared with theforest loss mapping results, and only cases in which both the remotesensing analysis and survey responses agreed were coded for thepresence of iLUC. All binary causal variables were coded into simple presence andabsence, whereas composite causal variables were calibrated withthree levels based on thresholds set to natural distribution breakpoints. Variable Definition Coding Procedure Deal Size  Reported area of concessioned land (ha), Code a ‘1’ if greater than 200 ha, and ‘0’ otherwise. Code as ‘1’ for rubber, and ‘0’ for non-rubber. Examples include reported land disputes (LICAHDO), re-taking or stopping use of LSLA land through force or threat of force For multiple village entries, report for the entire project the number of entries coded as '1' divided by the total number of entries. For example, a more conflictual livelihood context (sensu Oberlack et al., 2016), contested compensation, political advocacy If '1' is reported for any of the following variables, then that entry is coded as '1': Air pollution, Water contamination, Noise, Health deterioration, Significant negative impact from chemicals. If there are multiple entries, report for the entire project the number of entries coded as '1' divided by the total number of entries. If '1' is reported for any of the following variables, then that entry is coded as '1': All 'Decreasing access ...' variables; All 'Reduced availability ...' variables. If there are multiple entries, report for the entire project the number of entries coded as '1' divided by the total number of entries. Compensate Some form of individual compensation described, for Coded as 1/0 for ‘yes’/’no’ responses. Employment full Local community members employed in activties related to LSLA (code as 2) Code only if all rows in 'Employment/job creation' report '1', and no rows in 'Not enough jobs' report '1'  partial Only some local community members employed due to insufficient employment opportunities, competition from immigrants, or by choice as form of resistence (code as 1) Proportion of observations (i.e., rows) for 'Employment/job creation' that report '1'. For example, if a land concession has five row and only two have '1s', then this concession is coded as 'partial'. none No employment opportunities offered through LSLA (code as 0) Code only if no rows in 'Employment/job creation' report '1' Displacement Description of community displacement and/or out-migration resulting from LSLA If '1' is reported for any of the following variables, then that entry is coded as '1': 'Channels that households access new land' category selection except 'Using remaining land/household reserved land', or a 'Yes' response to 'Households moved out'. If there are multiple entries, report for the entire project the number of entries coded as '1' divided by the total number of entries. Immigration LSLA has resulted in in-migration, usually from migrants seeking employment If '1' is reported for any category in 'Origins of workers' selected other than or in addition to 'Within the village' or 'Don't know', then that entry is coded as '1'. Code as '0' if '1' is indicated in 'Using concession land' or '% Implemented' equals 0 (leave blank if 'Implemented area is not reported'. Code as '1' only if '% Implemented' is greater than 0.10, and code as '0.5' if '% Implemented' is less than or equal to 0.10. If '1' is reported for any of the following variables, then that entry is coded as '1':  'Purchased new land', 'Cleared village reserved farmland', or 'Cleared forest in the village or neighboring villages' is selected. If there are multiple entries, report for the entire project the number of entries coded as '1' divided by the total number of entries.";;;;;;;;

However, as other fish retrotran-sposons like the Rex3 LINE element evolved with a sur-prisingly low evolutionary rate (unpublished data), thisobservation cannot be used unambiguously to argue forhorizontal transfer.";Rex1/Babar retrotransposonsencode a reverse transcriptase and an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, which is very frequently removed byincomplete reverse transcription. Unlike SINE elements, complete versions of LTRand non-LTR retrotransposons encode their own enzy-matic machinery for transposition, including a reversetranscriptase (RT). Hence, complete versions of Rex1 and Babar retro-transposons encode an AP endonuclease. This confirmsthe scenario proposed for the evolution of non-LTR re-trotransposons (Malik, Burke, and Eickbush 1999).Comparing Rex1-Ten endonuclease amino acid sequenc-es with the ‘‘nr database’’ (nonredundant GenBank CDStranslations 1 PDB 1 SwissProt 1 PIR 1 PRF) on thencbi/nlm/nihadvancedBlastserver(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) revealed significantsimilarities only to AP endonucleases encoded by CR1-related retrotransposons, again suggesting a phylogenet-ic relationship of the Rex1/Babar family with the CR1clade (not shown). Rex1 and Babar retrotransposonsmight also encode an additional open reading frame, asobserved for most other non-LTR retrotransposons.Such an open reading frame was not detected in thiswork, probably because of the high frequency of 59 trun-cation of Rex1/Babar elements, and might be revealedby completion of the Fugu and Tetraodon genomeprojects.A certain degree of amino acid conservation wasdetected within the C-terminal domain flanking the RTregion of Rex1 and Babar elements, suggesting a func-tional role of this domain (fig. 1999),suggests that this region may serve as a recognition sitefor Rex1-encoded reverse transcriptase.Rex1 retrotransposons end with oligonucleotidetandem repeats of variable size (5–7 nt in length) andvariable sequence directly flanking the conserved 39-ter-minal region (fig.;;;;;;;;

Specifically, we compiled a data set of 1,788 independent experimental measures assessing coral responses to warming and increased CO2 levels conducted in tropical and sub-tropical regions from 172 published studies of 87 widely distributed coral species (Figures S2–S5; Table S2).

The analysis simulated changes in MHWs for tropical and subtropical regions (between +30 and −30 degrees latitude), cover-ing >95% of the geographical locations where our experimental data were obtained (Figure S3).2.2  |  Literature searchThe published experimental literature on responses of calcifying cor-als (Scleractinia: Anthozoa) to warming and elevated pCO2 in single and combined treatments was searched using the Web of Science® database. The original search collected data for all benthic cnidarians, but due to low replication of observations for non-calcifying taxa, we report only data for calcifying corals. However, data obtained from observations of ‘model’ ecosystems were extracted only if both control and treatment sites were included and the study included efforts to control other, po-tentially confounding variables among sites. We thus restricted the data set to experimental assessments that verified and reported the full carbonate system to estimate pCO2 levels in the treatments tested. manipulated total alkalinity rather than dissolved inorganic carbon) were excluded from the data set because this method does not accurately replicate changes to ocean carbonate chemistry (Gattuso & Lavigne, 2009).2.4  |  Data extraction and data set characteristicsTo assess the various biological responses of calcifying corals to warming, elevated pCO2 and the stressors combined, the following were selected as response attributes: symbiont density, chla con-tent, photosynthesis, photochemical efficiency (YII), calcification, host growth, host survival and dark (holobiont) respiration. Data extraction from figures was done using the image analysis software Graph Click© (for Mac OS, version 3.0) and Web Plot Digitizer © (for PC, version 4.0). If a study measured biological responses of multiple species or life-history stages, these data were also included as individual experi-ments. However, if a study recorded multiple metrics considered to reflect a single coral process, then only the most ‘inclusive’ variable was in-cluded (sensu, Kroeker et al., 2010, 2013).Due to low replication for non-calcifying taxa, 32 studies of non-calcifying taxa were excluded from the data set (Figure S2). We fur-ther restricted the data set to experimental assessments conducted in tropical and subtropical regions (between +35 and −35 degrees of latitude) and excluded 11 studies that assessed the responses of deep-sea corals to ensure the relevance of surface MHW scenarios (Figure S2).

These data permitted the deriva-tion of E as an effect size per unit temperature under the assumption that the differences conform to an Arrhenius model and was calculated as,where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature (in Kelvin). Although the data were extracted in a similar manner to E, the Ln RR effect size does not require the differences to conform to an Arrhenius model. These data permitted the derivation of an Ln RR as an effect size per unit pCO2 and was calculated as:where pCO2Exp and pCO2Cont are the pCO2 concentrations (in μatm) in experimental and control treatments respectively.The calculation of effect sizes allows experimental assess-ments to be pooled across different species that may employ dif-ferent approaches and methods, but measure a common effect. The 248 independent full-factorial experiments in the data set included four outcomes of experimental warming (xWarming), elevated pCO2 (xpCO2), warming and elevated pCO2 (xBoth) and a control treat-ment (xControl) to be included in the analysis. These data allowed for the determination of the interaction strength (Ln RRInter) and individual effects (Ln RRWarming and LnRRpCO2) for each factorial experiment and were calculated according to methods for full-factorial meta-analyses (Gurevitch et al., 2000; Harvey et al., 2013):Then the individual effects of the stressors were calculated as:where x is the mean biological response of the treatment (in subscript) and s is the pooled standard deviation calculated as:(1)Effect size(E) = lnVo∕Vi1kTo −1kTi,(2)Effect size(LnRRΔ100μatm−1 CO2) =LnRRΔpCO2 ×100=(lnxexp −lnxCont)(pCO2exp −pCO2Cont)×100,(3)LnRRInter =(LnxBoth −LnxWarming) −(LnxpCO2 −LnxControl)2s,(4)LnRRWarming =(LnxWarming −LnxCont)s,(5)LnRRpCO2 =(LnxpCO2 −LnxCont)s,(6)s =√((nBoth −1)× S2Both +(nWarming −1)× S2Warming +(npCO2 −1)× S2pCO2 +(nCont −1)× S2Cont)(nBoth + nWarming + npCO2 + nCont −4). We included study identification and coral genus as random variables to minimize potential bias from dependence among measures and elim-inate bias towards widely distributed species commonly assessed in our data set (e.g. The temperature and CO2 increases required to produce the least significant per cent change for each coral attribute were reported as estimates of statistical sensitivity to changes in temperature and CO2.where 1/kT values corresponding to temperature increases in °C were obtained from the calculated linear relationship between temperature increases in Celsius and 1/kT values in the data set.where ∆CO2 is the increase in the partial pressure of CO2 (in μatm).For each coral attribute, we calculated per cent changes at fu-ture MHW intensities projected under three main RCPs (2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) for the near-term (2021–2040), mid-century (2041–2060) and late-century (2081–2100) relative to present-day responses (control) using Equation (9). In contrast, the variability associated with most of our thermal sensitivity estimates was much smaller (Figures 2a and 3), indicating that future coral performance will be more dependent on intensifying temperatures than on OA.Among the seven coral attributes for which sufficient data were available in response to the dual stressors (Figure 2a), the amount of warming required to produce initial, significant declines in symbiont density, calcification and photosynthesis remained similar whether OA was concomitant (Figure 2b).

Based on these prior morphological observations, the broad distribution of the species and the differences in environmental conditions among tea-growing regions, we hypothesized that these morphological variations reflect genetic differences among geographic populations.Previous studies of the population structure and genetic dif-ferentiation of tea green leafhopper have used mitochondrial gene sequence data or limited numbers of microsatellite markers (Chen et al., 2015; Fu, Li, et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016, 2019; Zhang et al.,  2018; Zhou et al.,  2014; Zhu et al.,  2019). Microsatellite-based results revealed some geographical differen-tiation between populations, particularly between two populations in Yunnan and the other Chinese populations but provided only limited evidence of consistent population genetic structure, poten-tially affected by endogenous properties of the markers used (e.g., fluctuations in allele frequency and recombination rates), the quality of genetic data and the sampling methods. For the present study, we obtained more extensive data using next-generation sequenc-ing (NGS) to more fully characterize the genetic substructure in M. All the genotypic data conversions were performed with GenALEx v. onukii populations was estimated by poste-rior probability of the data (L (K)) and the ad hoc statistic (ΔK) using the Web server Clumpak was used to align results from replicate analyses and visualize population structure (Evanno et al.,  2005; Kopelman et al., 2015; Pritchard et al., 2000; Pritchard et al., 2010).

The optimal K for the SNP data in-ferred from FASTStructure ranged from 1 to 18 (Figure 4b), and the lowest cross-validation error (CV) was obtained for K = 3. Both datasets indicate that six populations of M. onukii from the Southwest tea produc-tion area in China are significantly differentiated from populations in all other sites, particularly populations in Japan (Figure S4).3.5  |  Isolation by distance analysisThe traditional Mantel test identified significant geographic dif-ferentiation among 18 populations in both marker datasets (SNPs: RXY = .461, p < .001; SSR: RXY = .426, p < .000) (Figure S5).

We trapped 4 native species of turtles (Apalone spinifera, Chrysemys picta,Pseudemys gorzugi, and Trachemys gaigeae gaigeae) in the Rio Grande and Black River (Pecos River drainage) of NewMexico in June 2012 and 2013 to collect data on female reproductive ecology, including clutch size, egg size, timing ofegg production, and percentage of gravid females. gorzugi (10 eggs) is only the second published record for that data-deficientspecies. This contributesto the dearth of state-specific ecological andreproductive data for most turtle species thatare otherwise fairly well studied outside NewMexico. Ongoing population sur-veys of turtles in and around Elephant ButteReservoir (EBR) on the Rio Grande and theBlack River of New Mexico provided an op -portunity to collect additional data on femalereproductive ecology for several turtle speciesthat we summarize in this paper.METHODS    Several of the authors have monitored tur-tle populations in the Rio Grande and PecosRiver in New Mexico for several decades.

We accounted for both data sourceand species phylogenetic relatedness.3. High trait variation occurred at local scales,suggesting that wide-ranging below-ground resource economics strategies are viable within mostclimatic areas and soil conditions.Key-words: climate, database, fine roots, functional biogeography, functional traits, N2-fixation,phylogeny, plant growth form, plant resource economics, soil propertiesIntroductionFine roots perform essential functions for plants includingnutrient and water acquisition (Waisel, Eshel & Kafkafi2002)and influence a broad spectrum of ecological processes, fromnet primary production (Cadotte et al.

This database was compiled by the© 2017 The Authors. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseauthors of this study from both published and unpublished datasetsresulting from their own work and an independent literature survey(Table S1, Supporting Information). This database is available as partof the Fine-Root Ecology Database (FRED; http://roots.ornl.gov;Iversen et al. A dataset was consid-ered suitable only when it contained at least two of the focal traits forat least three species grown in greenhouse, common-garden, planta-tion or natural conditions. Root trait data obtained on seedlings (sub-jective cut-off of <2 months for herbaceous and <6 months forwoody species) or in hydroponic conditions were excluded. When datasets included data from the same species in differentnatural sites, all observations were retained. This resulted in 55 data-sets with 8714 root trait observations for a total of 1115 species from597 genera in 135 families.Taxonomic nomenclature was standardized using accepted namesfrom The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/). With respect to plant functional types, species weresorted into four main growth forms (Graminoids, Forbs, Shrubs andTrees) and N2-fixation ability (able/not able to fix atmospheric N2),which were established based on the information provided in theTRY database (https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php). 2015) have advo-cated the use of more refined root sampling schemes, fine-roots≤2 mm form the bulk of fine-root trait data available at present andshow similar patterns to roots of the first three-orders only (Freschet& Roumet 2017). It is only slightly biased by the use of a ≤2 mm cut-offlimit because within this category fine-roots close to 2 mm in diame-ter represent only a small proportion of the total length of fine-rootsover which fine-root diameter is averaged.Owing to gaps in locally measured climate data, we used climatedata available from the Worldclim database (Hijmans et al. Climate dataresolution was 1 km2, and discrepancies between local climate dataand the Worldclim database were observed for high elevation siteswhere abrupt variation in altitude may not be accurately accounted forby the 1 km2 grid. To limit this bias, whenever high discrepancieswere recorded, local climate data rather than global data were retained.Across all studies, little common information was available regard-ing edaphic characterization. Common-garden and field observationswere therefore linked to soil properties as found in the HarmonizedWorld Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-CAS/JRC 2012) basedon their geographic coordinates. Only soil pH,cation exchange capacity and bulk density were kept in subsequentanalyses because of strong correlations among variables in theretrieved soil data – cation exchange capacity was strongly correlatedto soil organic carbon content (R2 = 072) and bulk density stronglycorrelated with soil clay content (R2 = 067) – in order to avoidissues of collinearity. Soil data were obtained from gridded datasetsof 1 km2, which we acknowledge can lead to biased representation ofthese variables in locations with wide ranges in climate and soil con-ditions, such as mountainous areas.ROOT DATA COVERAGEThe database covers most of the range of MAT–rainfall space inwhich higher plants are found, as well as the major climatic areas ofthe world. With respect to species countsacross broad phylogenetic clades, the representativeness of the datasetis reasonably good. Eudicots (56% of this dataset, compared to ~66%of the world’s species) and monocots (37% vs ~26%) account for thelargest number of species of vascular plants, followed by magnoliids(36% vs ~34%) and gymnosperms (26% vs ~03%), whereas pteri-dophytes are under-represented (11% vs ~43%). The four maingrowth forms are all well represented in the dataset, with forbs (37%of observations in this dataset, compared to ~34% of species in theTRY database) and graminoids (35% vs ~24%) being the two groupsmost represented, followed by trees (15% vs ~24%) and shrubs (12%vs ~18%). Finally, 69% of data was obtained on plantsgrowing in natural conditions against 10% in common-garden and21% in pots.PHYLOGENY CONSTRUCTIONA phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. We used S.PhyloMaker (Qian & Jin 2015) to generate a phy-logeny containing species from the Rhizopolis database from thismegaphylogeny. S1).DATA ANALYSISAs the data in these analyses represented 55 studies conducted usingdifferent methods and for different purposes, we treated ‘study’ as arandom effect. All fourtraits had k values significantly different from zero, suggesting signifi-cant phylogenetic signal in trait distribution and justifying the inclu-sion of phylogeny as part of the error structure in our models.Given the lack of within-species variation for most traits in thedataset and to avoid overfitting, we were unable to fit a general linearmixed model with phylogeny as a random effect (e.g. These models recognizethe shared evolutionary history and therefore non-zero error covari-ances among data points, and so they transform the data to reflectthis. Linear regression is then applied to the transformed data (Stone,Nee & Felsenstein 2011).For the first set of phylogenetic generalized least-square models,we included as fixed effects plant growth conditions, climatic area,plant growth form and N2-fixation capacity. In a second step, we repeated the sameapproach (accounting for species phylogeny) on a subset of our dataexcluding observations from plants grown indoors or in pot, in orderto test the effect of global climate and soil variables. Data for all four root variables were log-transformed prior toall analyses, and we determined that model assumptions were met foreach model.The interaction effects between MAT and MAP and between soilpH and cation exchange capacity on root traits were also included inthe second step of our analyses, but are not presented here as theywere consistently found to be non-significant for all four traits. As a point ofcomparison, the 20-fold difference in fine-root N (from 17 to393 mg g1) was twice its above-ground analogue, leaf N,in a dataset of comparable size and geographical spread (10-fold difference, from 63 to 587 mg g1; Freschet et al.2011). Locationofallsites(dots)fromwhich the data were obtained, as distributedacross the major climatic areas of the globe.[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]© 2017 The Authors. 4).Because climatic area is a relatively coarse index of climatevariation, we explored further the specific effects of selectedsoil and climate variables.Focusing on the subset of our data collected from outdoorconditions, there was no single climatic or soil variable thatconsistently explained the majority of variation in all fourfine-root traits (Table 2). For instance, the graminoid groupincludes almost all herbaceous monocots, whereas the forbgroupincludesallherbaceouseudicots.Theretained1Local datasets with most trait data count23456Globalvariaon1105050·1111010010000·110·50·050·520·20·020·2220Root nitrogen content (mg g–1)Specific root length (m g–1)Root tissue density (g cm–3)Mean root diameter (mm)Fig. Comparison of global fine-root trait variation (box-plot inbold = all fine-root <2 mm observations in our database) to this of asubset of local datasets (each other box-plot = fine-root observationsfor at least 15 species sampled within the same site) for the four mostcommonly measured traits in our database.

We analyzed the microsatellite data set under a Brownianapproximation model and mutation was considered to be constant for all loci.We used FST estimates and a UPGMA tree as starting parameters for theestimation of M and performed five independent runs using one long chainwith a run of 1107 recorded parameter genealogies after discarding the first1105 genealogies as burn-in for each locus. All pairwise j¢ST comparisons werealso significant and showed similar genetic patterns, with interiorpopulations less differentiated from each other (j¢ST1⁄40.017) andhigh genetic differentiation between island and mainland populations(j¢ST1⁄40.168–0.298).Assignment tests separated the sampled populations into six geneticclusters (K1⁄46), based on the log probability of data L(K), and theEvanno criterion for number of demes, D(K). The same pattern wasrecently detected for populations of slender salamanders, Batrachoseps,on the islands of San Francisco Bay (Martı ́nez-Solano and Lawson,2009), which share similar age (9000 years) and distances amongislands and mainland.A third possible scenario to explain the genetic divergence foundbetween these populations is one of isolation and incipient geneticdifferentiation by genetic drift before the formation of the islands.Although, with the data at hand, population isolation pre- or post-island formation cannot be distinguished, our data point out togenetic differentiation facilitated by restriction of gene flow betweenpopulations after island formation, as only distant interior popula-tions are not differentiated (Figure 2).Population genetics of island and mainland S. salamandra will be a useful next stepin this system.Our data did not allow us to distinguish whether viviparity evolvedindependently on each island or whether viviparous populationsoccurred in coastal populations before the rise of the sea level, withposterior replacement and exclusion from the continent by ovovivipar-ous populations. gallaica (Figure 1), the genetic simila-rities between island and coastal mitochondrial DNA haplotypes(Velo-Anto ́n et al., 2007), and particular aspects of the insular environ-ment suggest a rapid (within the last 9000 years) and independentchange of reproductive mode for each population since their isolation.Conservation implicationsOur data show that the interior populations show higher geneticdiversity and historical population sizes than island or coastal popula-tions, yet they are facing reduction in current population sizes(Table 4), probably owing to anthropogenic habitat loss. salamandra as a model for investigatingrapid evolutionary change in populations with different histories andecological settings.Rapid evolution of viviparity in insular salamandersG Velo-Anto ́n et al416HeredityDATA ARCHIVINGData have been deposited at Dryad: doi:10.5061/dryad.

The first was a trans-Pacific transit (Hong Kongto Long Beach, CA) utilizing a Volunteer Observing Ship(VOS) container ship, the OOCL Tokyo (16–29 May 2011).Forty-five (45) surface samples and ancillary hydrographicdata (temperature, salinity) were collected. Total errors for129I/127I ratios average 5 %.We compare our results with data from the IAEA-97 radio-chemistry cruise (Povinec et al., 2003) and individual pro-files to the northeast of Japan (Suzuki et al., 2010, 2013).One of the IAEA-97 stations is from within the climatolog-ical mean of the Kuroshio near the northwest edge of theNorth Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG), one station from justwithin the western NPSG, and two near the Marshall Is-lands from within the North Equatorial Current. For most of thedata the uncertainties are the same size as the symbols. This assessmentcan be done using internal tracer–tracer (e.g., 129I–134Cs or137Cs) relationships, “far-field” data from samples that arelikely to be uninfluenced by Fukushima directly released ef-fluent (but possibly influenced via atmospheric deposition),and local pre-Fukushima 129I data.Considerable effort has been devoted to the measurementof 134Cs and 137Cs in the samples obtained during the KOKcruise and an extensive data set has been published (Bues-seler et al., 2012). These Cs isotope data, in conjunctionBiogeosciences, 11, 4839–4852, 2014www.biogeosciences.net/11/4839/2014/T. Cesium data from Buesseler et al. 134Cs has a ref-erence (decay-corrected) date of 6 April 2011: the date of the high-est direct discharge as indicated by The Tokyo Electric Power Com-pany (TEPCO) and Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Scienceand Technology (MEXT) monitoring.with our 129I KOK data, provide the basis for a tracer–tracerassessment of the “pre-event” 129I levels. There is a cluster of un-related data points at very lowreported cesium activities. The low Csdata points which seem to “falloff” the plot, reflect the en-trainment of subsurface non-Fukushima labeled water withwater that has been weakly impacted by Fukushima. Usingall of the reported WHOI data, the projected zero 134Cs ac-tivity intercept has a 129I/127I ratio of 1.3 × 10−11 (95 % CI:1.26–1.34 × 10−11) or 4.5 × 10−6 Bq m−3 (95 % CI: 4.29–          1024.01024.51025.01025.51026.01026.51027.01027.5Potential density (kg-m-3)129I Bq-m-3R/V KOK 062011OOCL Tokyo Trans−Pacific Surface 052011SY09 (Suzuki et al., 2013)OS08 (Sukuki et al., 2013)Miyako (Suzuki et al., 2013)129I/127IPre-event profiles1x10-121x10-111x10-101x10-91x10-41x10-51x10-61x10-7Figure 6. 129I data from the KOK and OOCL Tokyo and data fromthree hydrographic stations (Suzuki et al., 2013) that were collectedin 2008 and 2009: OS08 (filled triangles), SY09 (upside down trian-gles), Miyake (bulls eye). Formost of the data, the uncertainties are the same size of the symbols.Exceptions include the lowest values of Suzuki et al. Decay cor-recting the 134Cs data from the reported 6 April 2011 refer-ence of peak Fukushima input into the ocean to 11 March2011, the date of the earthquake does not lead to a signif-icant difference in these 129I–134Cs tracer–tracer interceptcalculations of the “pre-event” 129I concentration (activity)or 129I/127I ratio.Although we expect that some portion of the OOCL Tokyosurface samples could be impacted by Fukushima-derived129I, particularly those directly to the east of Japan, we cancompare these “far-field” data to provide an alternative as-sessment of the “pre-event” 129I levels. (2013) presented 129I data from threehydrographic casts off the northeast coast of Japan. Similar to theKOK data, Suzuki et al. At higher densities (deeper depths), the KOK andpre-event Suzuki et al., data are indistinguishable (Fig. 6).The three independent methods to determine the pre-event129I concentration, of which two are completely indepen-dent data sets, have produced estimates that are consistentwith each other and indicate that over the recent past surface129I activities have been 1–2 × 10−5 Bq m−3. (2013) there may be a slight latitudinal de-pendence of 129I in surface waters of the western subtropicalNorth Pacific, although in the OOCL Tokyo data we do notobserve any trend between 22◦and 35◦north latitude.4.2Estimate of 129I/137Cs and 129I/134Cs offFukushima in June 2011Using all of the WHOI cesium data, we estimate the129I / 134Cs and 129I / 137Cs activity ratios (unitless) of a hy-pothetical Fukushima endmember via Keeling plot analysis(i.e., 1/Cs activity vs. NYK cesium data from Aoyama et al. The 129I / 134Cs endmember estimate fromthis data set is slightly sensitive to the chosen reference date;decay correcting the 134Cs data from the defined (Buesseleret al., 2012) 6 April 2011 reference point (inferred maximumdirect discharge date) to the 11 March 2011 date of the earth-quake yields an activity ratio of 3.7 × 10−7 (95 % CI: 3.62–3.84 × 10−7).4.3Estimating the influence of 129I atmosphericdepositionBecause 129I has a much lesser potential radiological healthimpact than 131I or 134Cs, observations of 129I are not madeas frequently. Given that currently there are no direct measure-ments of 129I in particulates and aerosols with correspond-ing cesium data, we estimate the atmospheric depositionfrom data derived from the US International Monitoring Sys-Biogeosciences, 11, 4839–4852, 2014www.biogeosciences.net/11/4839/2014/T. Thus, the exercisebelow should be considered one possible endmember-basedrelation.Post-event aerosol and particulate data document that theactivity of 137Cs to 131I (decay corrected to release date)is 1–2 % (Masson et al., 2012), i.e., a 131I / 137Cs (activ-ity) ratio of ∼66.7. It is this2.1 × 110−6 129I / 134Cs activity ratio that we use in the fol-lowing to estimate the influence of atmospheric deposition of129I.To estimate the potential impact of atmospheric depo-sition, we utilize the surface VOS Nippon Yusen Kaisha(NYK) 134Cs data of Aoyoma et al. We decay cor-rect the NYK 134Cs data from the reported date of collec-tion, which is the reference date for the decay-correction ap-plied in reporting the 134Cs data (Aoyama personal commu-nication, 2013), to 11 March 2011. The implied potential at-mospheric deposition of 129I into surface waters implied bythe NYK data is, for the most part, similar to that observedby our OOCL Tokyo samples. Even if the 129I–134Cs relationis an order of magnitude larger, the NYK data imply that a            1024.01024.51025.01025.51026.01026.51027.01027.51-11101102103Potential density (kg-m-3)134Cs or 137Cs Activity (Bq-m-3)134Cs137CsFigure 8. 134Cs data are referenced (decay-corrected) to 6 April 2011. Data of Buesseler et al., 2012.129I source other than Fukushima is required to produce theincrease in 129I that we observe in the CCS.4.4129I budget and mixing of Fukushima-derived 129Iinto the western PacificAs previously discussed, the events at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant released radionuclides into both theatmosphere and, as a consequence of fire fighting and con-tainment efforts, directly released into the coastal ocean. Contrary to theseindependent methodologies and tracer data, the 129I dataof Hou et al. 129I data from figure 5 with those of Hou et al. (2012)cesium data and our 129I results from the same cruise, andthe consistency between our 129I data and that of Suzuki etal. (2013) 129I data at all depths. Thus, we restrictthe discussion of the 129I results and estimated excess 129Ibudget to our data.Following the region analysis of Buesseler et al. For in-ternal consistency we define the pre-Fukushima 129I contentusing the 134Cs zero intercept for 134Cs data > 1.5 Bq m−3(129I/127I 2.4 × 10−11, 0.9 × 10−5 Bq m−3) and, via sim-ple subtraction, calculate the excess inventory as a functionof depth (Fig. An admittedly crudeestimate of the iodine flux lost via sinking phytoplanktoncan be derived taking advantage of the carbon export datafrom the long-term sediment trap program and short-termdrifting sediment traps at the KNOT, K2, and S1 sites (e.g.,Honda et al., 2002; Kobari et al., 2013; see also http://ebcrpa.jamstec.go.jp/k2s1/en/dst.html). Moreover, if precise and accurate, the cesiummodeling assessment allows us to estimate the actual directdischarge 129I–134Cs (and 129I–137Cs) relation from0.95[129I/134Cs]direct + 0.05[2.1 × 10−6]atm = 3.7 × 10−7observedSolving yields 2.8 × 10−7(unitless activity ratio) for129I / 134Cs and 3.2 × 10−7 for 129I / 137Cs.4.5California Coastal Current 129IThere were only a few NYK samples in the eastern Pa-cific that detected 134Cs and thus implicate atmosphericdeposition of 129I, whereas the OOCL Tokyo data showthat 129I in eastern surface waters is consistently elevatedcompared to the far western and central Pacific (Fig. A simplesalinity-based two-endmember model using the Richland129I concentration (0 psu, 1.8–4.6 × 10−3 Bq m−3) and an“unperturbed” average eastern Pacific surface value of1.2 × 10−5 Bq m−3 (33.27 psu) from the OOCL Tokyo dataallow us to infer that the CCS maximum values that weobserve (2.0 × 10−5 Bq m−3) could be accommodated withonly a fraction of a percent of direct dilution of surface oceanwaters with Columbia River water. Further isolation ofthe 129I source and overall impact of atmospheric depositionof 129I in eastern Pacific surface waters will require addi-tional samples and radiochemical tracer–tracer analysis thatcan uniquely distinguish Fukushima-derived fallout from theColumbia River or other potential point sources.4.6Penetration of 129I into subsurface water massesAlthough the region off Fukushima has, due to the conflu-ence of the Kuroshio and Oyahio currents, more compli-cated dynamics than the “open” Pacific, we can explore the129I data in the context of a conventional transient oceano-graphic tracer. To demonstratethis point, we compare our results and the pre-event dataof Suzuki et al. Tritium data wereobtained from the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Of-fice (http://cchdo.ucsd.edu/pacific.html). The tritium data are de-cay corrected to a common reference year of 2010. We chosethis year to be close to the 2008 and 2009 pre-event data ofSuzuki et al., and our observations in 2011. For visual clar-ity we restrict our (KOK) data to non-Fukushima impactedsamples and densities greater than 1026.5 kg m−3 (Fig. 11).Tritium and 129I data exhibit the same general curvature anddescribe a typical (vertical) diffusive transient tracer profilewith input at the surface (cf. Thus theprofiles indicate a first-order source of anthropogenic 129Iwhich is likely atmospheric deposition of 129I from initialatmospheric weapons testing with subsequent atmosphericdeposition from other anthropogenic sources such as repro-cessing (Toyama et al., 2012).In contrast to these consistent atmospheric testing sourcedtransient tracer data,129I data from the central equa-torial and western Pacific during a 1997 IAEA cruise(Povinec et al., 2000, 2010, 2013) present a large and re-gional elevation in 129I above not only pre-anthropogenic129I/127I (≤1.5 10−12) but also above the data of Suzuki et              1026.01026.51027.01027.51028.01x10-13Potential density (kg-m-3)Tritium Units2004 (P02 CLIVAR)  solid blue symbols1993 (P10 WOCE) open grey circles129I/127I129I red solid symbols1x10-121x10-111x10-101x10-31x10-21x10-11Figure 11.

Tritium data from selected stations near Japan fromWOCE P10 in 1993 (stations 79, 81, 83, 85, 88, 90: open circles)and the CLIVAR reoccupation of P02 in 2004 (stations: 11, 15, 19,23, 28: filled blue circles). Tritium data have been decay correctedto a common reference of 2010.al. (2010, 2013) and our own “non-Fukushima influenced”data (Fig. 12).If real, the data from the IAEA 97 cruise indicate a sig-nificant perturbation to the North Pacific pre-anthropogenic129I budget at all sampled depths, i.e., extending to 5000 m.129I data from stations 2 and 3 as a function of depth(Povinec personal communication, 2013) and stations 6and 7 (digitized from figure 3 presented in Povinec et al.,2010) were placed on density horizons using the corre-sponding CTD data collected during the cruise on the R/VBosei Maru. Upper ocean samples are also dis-tinguished by their high values of (5.9 ± 1.1) × 10−11 (1 SD,range: 3.9 × 10−11 to 7.8 × 10−11) for depths less than 800 m(< 1027.0 kg m−3) at stations 2 and 3, and similar densitiesnear Bikini and Einewetak (depths shallower than 500 m)average (6.6 ± 2.4) × 10−11 (1 SD, range: 3.2 × 10−11 to1.1 × 10−10).To estimate this possible perturbation to the North Pa-cific pre-anthropogenic 129I budget, we simplify the regioncontained by stations 2, 3, 6, and 7 (Povinec et al., 2003,2010) to a triangle with an area in excess of 2.4 × 106 km2.We fit a smoothed polynomial to the merged 129I data pre-sented in Fig. Guilderson et al.: The 129-iodine content of subtropical Pacific waters4849        1026.51027.01027.51028.010-1310-1210-1110-10Potential density (kg-m-3)129I/127I129I data from figure 11IAEA 97 Station 2IAEA 97 Station 3IAEA 97 Station 6IAEA 97 Station 7Figure 12. 129I data from Fig. Note thatregardless of location: western subtropical North Pacific (stations2, 3: squares) or low latitudes near Bikini/Enewetak (stations 6, 7:diamonds) that the IAEA 97 data imply a significant 129I excess atall densities (depths to 5000 m sampled).interval interpolate the data with a step of 0.1 at 0.05 densityhorizons (e.g., 1026.95, 1027.05, 1027.15). For shallowerdepths, and to account for the small 129I latitudinal depen-dence in surface waters observed between 36 and 44◦N, weuse a constant 129I / /127I of 2.8 × 10−11, which is consistentwith our OOCL Tokyo data for stations south of 35◦N. To put this “anomaly” in perspective, the totalglobal release of 129I during atmospheric weapons testing isestimated to have been 90 (±50 %) kg (Snyder et al., 2010).From the available 129I release data it is difficult to ascertainthe validity of the proportionally large 129I input implied bythe IAEA 97 cruise data, which is equivalent to ∼30 % of theestimated global fallout from all atmospheric weapons test-ing. The activity ratio ofdirect discharge is an order of magnitude less than that im-plied by aerosol and related data: 2.1 × 10−6.Surface water samples from in and near the Califor-nia Coastal Current System have slightly elevated 129I val-ues compared with waters to the west.

037;;;;;;;False;;False;;;[];;One of the important fea-tures of Bayesian statistics is Occam’s Razor—an inbuilt preference for simplermodels when comparing competing models that explain some observed dataequally well. IntroductionPrediction is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems ranging from basicmotor control in animals to scientific hypothesis formation in humans [1–6].A fundamental problem of such predictive systems is how to choose between mul-tiple competing hypotheses that explain observed data equally well, but makedifferent predictions. In Bayesianinference, the simplicity or complexity of a model can be illustrated by the distri-bution over different datasets the model can explain (figure 1a). A simple modelpredicts only a small number of specific datasets, whereas a more flexible complexmodel can explain a wider range of data. If a particular dataset can be explained byboth models, the more complex model has to assign lower probability to this data-set than the simpler model, because it has to spread its probability mass over manydifferent datasets. The black dotsrepresent a number of observed data points and the coloured curves representpotential underlying processes. When trying to fit the observed datapoints with a curve, the difficulty lies in trading off the fitting error against thecomplexity of the hypothesis [9]. (a) Schematic plot of evidence p(DjM) for a simple model M1 (blue, solid line) and a complex model M2 (red, dashed line) fordifferent data D, such as different random trajectories. The most complexmodel (red line) is too flexible and passes exactly through each data point, thus achieving a fitting error of zero. To illustrate the com-plexity of the two models, we generated artificial observationdatasets and ordered them according to the probability of thedatasets under model M1 (see [8] for a discussion on how toillustrate the hypothetical plot on real data). In the simulationresults shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S1,it can be seen that the simpler model M1 concentrates its prob-ability mass on a smaller subset of data than model M2, whichcorresponds in essence to the schematic plot in figure 1a.Another advantage of using GP models (with a Gaussian like-lihood model) is that the log-probability of the model underuninformative prior can be expressed in closed form aslog p(Mijy) / 12yTS1li y|fflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflffl}goodness of fit12 log jSlij|fflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflffl}model complexity,(2:1)where Sli is a covariance matrix associated with model i and yare the noisy observations. The first term is a data-driven good-ness-of-fit error term. The second term is a data-independentcomplexity penalization and instantiates Occam’s Razor. In physics, the complex-ity term is a log partition function that measures the effectivenumber of possible states, which can also be interpreted interms of the complexity of decision-making processes [23,24].The complexity penalization term also has an information-the-oretic interpretation within the framework of minimumdescription length [25] that specifies the minimum amount ofinformation needed in a message that encodes the recordeddata. The total message length L 1⁄4  log p(D, Mi) can bedecomposed into message length LD 1⁄4  log p(DjMi) neededto record the data under a given model Mi and the messagelength LM 1⁄4  log p(Mi) required to specify the model itself.Complex models can encode data efficiently (low LD), butrequire detailed model specifications (high LM). In terms of theobserved choice behaviour in ambiguous trials, we found nosystematic difference between the two groups (figure 2d).(c) Model choice in general probe trialsWhile ambiguous stimulus trials directly demonstrate Occam’sRazor, the framework of Bayesian modelling allows for moregeneralquantitativepredictions.Inparticular,Bayesianmodels weight goodness of fit and model complexity for arbi-trary stimuli, including the ambiguous ones just described.The comparison between the experimentally observed choiceprobabilities and the fitted theoretical choice probabilities forall probe trials is shown in figure 2b,c,e,f using the pooleddata across all subjects both for drawing and clickingtrials. If model M2 generates wigglytrajectories that are highly reproducible across trials (i.e.with low variability), it constitutes a simple model, becauseit cannot explain many different datasets. If, by contrast,model M1 generates smooth trajectories with low spatial fre-quency, but with high noise and signal variability, it might beable to explain more datasets than the wiggly model.

The study demonstrates that plant barcoding is already feasible with thecurrent publicly available data. Isley & Alexander 1949;Post 2002), but require precise identification of plants,which may be complicated when reproductive parts or otherdiagnostic features are absent (Stewart 1967).Large-scale genetic data acquisition in taxonomy(‘DNA barcoding’) now permits whole species inventoriesor assessment of species diversity, based on standardizedshort-sequence fragments. 2008) for which representation in databasesincreases rapidly, improving the accuracy and speed ofhost plant identification. MATERIAL AND METHODS(a) Data collectionThe provenance of specimens used in this study is presentedin the electronic supplementary material (figs S1 and S2).DNA was extracted from whole beetles by soaking thespecimens in extraction buffer using the DNeasy Blood andTissue Extraction kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). trnL sequences have been deposited at the EBI underaccession numbers FM160425–FM160505, and beetlesequencesunderFM209215–FM209246(cox1)andFM209248-FM209279 (EF1a).(b) Phylogenetic reconstructionEach plant trnL sequence was compared against the GenBanknr database using the BLASTn algorithm and default searchparameters (Altschul et al. 2008), rbcL and trnL stood out as best candidates foridentification based on their high representation insequence databases. Where mixed sequence reads required cloningand sequencing of multiple clones, two divergent trnLsequences were obtained in three of seven cases (table S1in the electronic supplementary material), resulting in 81different trnL intron sequences.Fortaxonomicidentifications,thetrnLintronsequences were associated with existing data usingphylogenetic analysis and measures of similarity. The phylogenetic reconstruction wasalways sufficient to narrow downthe host plant hypothesis tovery few species using floristic data for the particular areawhere the beetles were collected (fig. In most casesthe divergence between query and top GenBank hit waslower than the mean divergence at the genus or tribe level,demonstrating the great precision of most identifications.However, this type of analysis is only useful if taxonomiccoverage of the predicted hierarchical group is largelyuniform in the database, as divergences may be biased ifonly closely related species are represented (depressing theaverage divergence), while the query sequence may behighly divergent to the sampled species. This explains highvariance in sequence divergence in the all-against-allcomparisons and very high divergence of the query fromits closest relative in some cases in our analysis (figure 1).Underlying taxonomy (but also taxonomic decisions ofsequence data submitters) are an important source of biasas divergence estimates of non-natural groups can inflateboth divergence and variance measures (e.g. In general, these analyses confirmed theresults from the phylogenetic identifications, showing thatlevels of sequence divergences with the query fell withinthe ranges observed in the groups to which a sequence hadbeen associated.(b) Barcoding an ecological associationWhen trnL intron sequences were used for tree-buildingwithout inclusion of GenBank data, major clades in thistree corresponded well to families and genera whenlabelled based on their taxonomy assignment from topGenBank hits, and the tree was generally consistent withcurrent plant systematics (figure 2). This procedure forsummarizing the data confirmed that the identificationobtained for each case (table 1; fig. This observationgreatly increases our confidence in the inference of hostassociations using this method.Correct identification of host plants greatly depends onthe taxonomic representation in sequence databases. This affects thephylogenetic host inference when constructing the datamatrix, as the assessment against distantly related taxamay lead to inconsistent relationships due to long-branchattraction. S1 in the electronic supplementary material).Ultimately, however, only denser taxon sampling in thereference database can solve the problem of potentiallyspurious identification. First, the paucity of representation for somebotanical groups in the database may depend on whichmarker is used for the analysis. B (2009)we found that even in these cases, a query sequence will beplaced correctly, provided there is at least one fairly closerelative in the database. Finally,using only a single marker may increase the susceptibilityof the study to inaccurate identification, incorrect labellingor poor sequence quality in the reference database (e.g.Korning et al. B (2009)phylogenetic re-evaluation after removing problematicsequence data.All of the above would argue for the use of additionalmarkers, and to improve precision and confidence of hostplant identification. EF1a; figure 3).While the precision of the analysis would improve, thismay come at the cost of fewer analyses and ultimatelyfewer host records that could establish precise host ranges.Sampling more individuals will also fill out the trees withadditional species of both herbivores and plants, and willimprove the quality of reference databases and theprecision of identifications.In this first application of the method, we obtained ahighly diverse array of trophic behaviours for AustralianChrysomelinae. 2007), whichseems to provide useful inferences at least at familylevel (data not shown). The use of this smaller, yetinformative, marker could broaden the suitability ofthis technique for samples where an even higher degreeof DNA degradation is expected (starved or even drycollection specimens).The future implementation of this method will benefitfrom the growing taxonomic coverage in databases andregional genetic botanical inventories, improved methodsfor match analysis that overcome the limitations ofBLAST, and the use of multiple marker systems to refinethe identification of hosts. 1996Cleaning the GenBank Arabidopsis thaliana data set.";"Marı ́tim de la Barceloneta 37,08003 Barcelona, SpainShort-sequence fragments (‘DNA barcodes’) used widely for plant identification and inventorying remainto be applied to complex biological problems. Here we demonstrate that DNA barcodes can greatlyimprove this situation as they (i) provide a secure identification of host plant species and (ii) establish theauthenticity of the trophic association. Host plants of leaf beetles (subfamily Chrysomelinae) fromAustralia were identified using the chloroplast trnL(UAA) intron as barcode amplified from beetle DNAextracts. Phylogenetic analysis of beetles shows general conservation of host association butwith rare host shifts between distant plant lineages, including a few cases where barcodes supported twophylogenetically distant host plants. By sequencing plant barcodes directly from DNA extractions made fromherbivorous beetles, strong physical evidence for the host association is provided. In plants, several ‘barcode’ locihave been proposed (e.g. RESULTS(a) Characterization of diet trnL and its usageas barcodeAmong possible plant barcodes (ITS, trnH-psbA, rbcL,trnL, rpoC1, rpoB, matK; Taberlet et al. 2007) and in our handsproduced more robust amplifications than other potentialbarcode markers such as rbcL and matK (Bradley et al.2007; Matheson et al.

Toaccomplish this, we filled critical sampling gaps in the high-elevation Oregon Cascades and low-elevation interior westernU.S., where few nuclear data have been available until now. We were specifically interested inthe southern Cascades of Oregon and California, where theconservation status has been poorly defined due to a lack ofdata. We excluded any finalgenotypes composed of <29 loci to minimize effects of missing data.Based on this dataset, we calculated per-locus heterozygosity, observednumber of alleles, and degree of deviance from Hardy–Weinbergequilibrium (FIS) and its statistical significance using packages hierfstat(Goudet 2005) and pegas (Paradis 2010) in R v.4.0.2 (R Development Core).Population structure.We used three individual-based clustering methodsto explore population structure: nonspatial Bayesian clustering in StructureFig. After removing 1% of the runs with the lowest values, we calculated themean log posterior probability of the data in Structure Harvester (Earl andvonHoldt 2012) and identified a range of reasonable K values based onwhere likelihoods approached a plateau. In Tess, we first ran ten modelswith no admixture for K = 2–20 to obtain an upper bound on the numberof clusters in the data. For DAPC assignments, we used the K-means clustering algorithmand Bayesian Information Criteria in R package adegenet (Jombart 2008) todetermine the number of clusters that most efficiently summarized thedata. Instead, wevisualized individual runs with the highest support (based on DIC andposterior probability) for a range of K values that seemed to describe themajority of the structure in the data (Pritchard et al. For genetic clusters that were categorized as “discrete”(see “Population structure”), we drew minimum convex polygons aroundtheir members and incorporated all individuals within, including those thatwere assigned to different clusters and were presumed to be immigrants.For genetic clusters deemed to have more continuous or complexstructure,ratherthanpartitioningdatawitharbitrarygeographicboundaries, we estimated summary statistics using Wright’s (1946)concept of a genetic neighborhood, which describes the local area inwhich most matings occur. For estimates of matrilinealdiversity, we calculated gene diversity (the equivalent of expectedheterozygosity for diploid data) according to Nei (1987). For continuouspopulations, we modified the sGD function to calculate gene diversityusing haplotype frequency data (i.e., according to Nei 1987) with the sameneighborhood approach as described for autosomal diversity.Y chromosome.A Y-chromosome phylogeographic network for NorthAmerican red foxes has yet to be resolved. We allowed for missing data at≤3 loci and used linkage to impute them based on an exclusive 100%match of the 11–14 alleles present with another complete haplotype, for atotal of 282 Y-microsatellite haplotypes in the western U.S. 2021); however, only one SNPwas polymorphic in our dataset outside of Alaska (SNP-39) and wastherefore the only one retained for final analysis. Thus, our data suggest a contemporary geneticstructure of western red foxes caused in large part by distinctanthropogenic factors. At the time of initial review, no nuclear data were availablefrom the Oregon Cascades and listing of the Southern CascadeDPS was declined based solely on a distribution of sightingrecords spanning the length of the Oregon Cascades (U.S. In theabsence of abundance data, the low genetic effective populationsizes and diversities observed in this study signal that theconservation status may not be all that more robust for theCascade subspecies in Washington or the Southern Cascade DPSof the Sierra Nevada subspecies than it is for the endangeredSierra Nevada DPS.In the meantime, our findings raise the possibility thatregardless of poorly understood contemporary stressors (Perrineet al. 2016) with variationin fitness-related traits among western populationsHowever, even without additional study, the current data aresufficient to implicate small population effects as a credible andimmediate threat to the persistence of the Lassen population(e.g., following guidelines in Frankham et al. The geneticdata definitively show that the Lassen and Oregon Cascadepopulations are not connected by long-distance dispersal, assuggested in previous assessments (U.S. Quinn et al.132Heredity (2022) 129:123 – 136when the entire dataset was analyzed, implying either a high levelof contemporary connectivity or a common founding source.These findings are consistent with conclusions of previous studies(e.g., Statham et al. 2015), but are based on amore comprehensive geographic and genomic dataset. Increased sampling of more high-elevation montaneregions in the Rocky Mountains and higher-powered genomicdatasets (e.g., reduced representation-sequencing) could helpelucidate more precisely how landscape features correspond tononnative admixture.The compositions of nonnative matrilines and patrilines wereinsufficient on their own to discriminate between fur-farm andwildmidcontinentpopulationsastheprincipalsourceofadmixture.

With the increasing prominenceof larger, higher severity fires on the landscape, it is importantto understand how shifting fire regimes affect the floral andfaunal diversity of these fire-prone systems.Here, we evaluatewhether pyrodiversity begets biodiversitywith an extensive dataset (over 38 000 detection records) fromavian surveys across approximately465 000 ha ofburned coniferforest in the Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascade mountainsof California, USA. Material and methods(a) Study area and data collectionThis study was conducted during 2009–2014 as part of a bio-regional monitoring programme in burned conifer forests. Each year we used GIS layers from theUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Serviceto extract data for all fires that had occurred during the previous10 years across 10 National Forest units in California and thatburned at least 50 ha of conifer forest at medium or high severity.From this available pool, approximately 50 fires were selected atrandom for surveys in any given year, independent of samplingin previous years (figure 1).The first time each fire was surveyed, between 3 and 12 surveypoints (median 1⁄4 9) were established at least 250 m apart along alinear transect with a randomly selected starting point withinthe fire perimeter. When fires were revisited in subsequentyears, attempts were made to re-sample at the same locations.Where post-fire salvage logging occurred at points prior to surveys(n 1⁄4 247, 9.7% of points; as defined by the Forest Activity TrackingSystem database: http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/rsl/clearinghouse/gis-download.shtml), affected survey points were subsequentlyexcluded from analysis.Surveys began within 10 min of official local sunrise, werecompleted by 3.5 h after sunrise and were conducted betweenrspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgProc. Surveys were subdivided into intervals ofvarying numbers of minutes to provide intra-survey temporalreplication conducive to modelling detection probabilities [40].Surveys began with a 3 min survey interval followed by either asingle 2 min survey interval in 2009 or two 2 min intervalsthereafter.The final dataset for analysis was organized into a four-dimensional array, yi,j,k,t, where i 1⁄4 1, . Specific variables chosen included: (i) elevation,derived from a 30 m California digital elevation model [43];(ii) number of years since fire (range 1–10 years); (iii) pre-fireper cent tree canopy cover, calculated by averaging midpoints ofmean per cent tree cover within 100 m buffers around surveypoints (derived from 100 m resolution California Multi-sourceLandCoverData:http://frap.cdf.ca.gov/data/frapgisdata-sw-fveg_download.php), and (iv) burn severity, as measured bychange in per cent canopy cover based on the satellite-derived,relativized difference normalized burn ratio score [44] providedby the USDA Forest Service (J. species richness) that can only be estimatedwhen data for all species are available [48].We developed a temporally dependent Bayesian hierarchicalmodel, where yi,j,k,t is a binomial random variable that indicatesif species i was detected (yi,j,k,t 1⁄4 1) or not detected (yi,j,k,t 1⁄4 0)at sampling point j during survey interval k in year t. We useda mixture model specification to describe the data generat-ing process in terms of probability distributions, such thatyi,j,k,t ≏Bernoulli( pi,j,k,t  zi,j,t), where zi,j,t is a latent variableused to indicate true occurrence of species i at point j in year t,modelled as zi,j,t ≏Bernoulli(ci,j,t). All first-order continuous occupancy anddetectability covariates were standardized to a mean of 0 and astandard deviation of 1.We fitted the model to the data with JAGS [50] using the Rstatistical programming language v. As all diversity metricscome from the z-matrix, all derived diversity metrics account forimperfect detection and include propagated uncertainty.We used the detection-corrected posterior z-matrix to calculatemultiple spatial and temporal indices of diversity in burned forests.Point-level richness was calculated as the sum of the true occur-rence matrix for a given point and number of years after fire.Similarly, we estimated fire-level richness for each sampled yearas the number of species estimated to occur at least once acrossall points surveyed within a fire.We calculated gamma diversity as the number of bird speciesfound at least once within each burn-severity class (low, medium,high severity and unburned) and number of years post-fire (1–10),pooling data across all 97 surveyed fires. Our study followsthe changing avian community in the 10 years followingfire and evaluates the role of spatial heterogeneity in fireseverity and time since fire in structuring diversity using aspatially and temporally extensive dataset from the montaneforests of inland California.Our analysis of the effects of burn severity on bird diversityacross two spatial scales indicates strong support of the claimthat pyrodiversity increases biodiversity. The importance of such ‘mixed-severity’ fire isan emerging principle in fire ecology [21], but mixed-severityfire, which is already at risk owing to the legacy of fire suppres-sion and even-aged stand management [61,62], may becomeless frequent owing to the increasing prevalence of large andhomogeneoushigh-severityfiresresultingfromclimatechange [31,36].Data accessibility.

Our data suggests these errors are unlikely to bias trend estimates at large scales (e.g., within woodcock management regions), but there may be potential for bias at more local scales (e.g., state or provincial population indices). In North America continental-scale monitoring of migratory birds is conducted via standardized surveys, which provide among the most expansive wildlife count data in existence (Anderson et al. Author Manuscript These datasets are instrumental in conducting conservation status assessments (Rosenberg et al. But the degree to which survey design accommodates the timing of migration can affect data reliability (Finger et al. Longstanding concerns over range-wide population declines in American woodcock (Scolopax minor; woodcock) are based principally on data collected through the American Woodcock Singing Ground Survey (SGS; Sauer and Bortner 1991, Seamans and Rau 2022). The SGS data have also been used to estimate regional abundance, set population and habitat goals (Kelley et al. To address these questions, we used data from global positioning system (GPS) transmitters deployed as part of the Eastern Woodcock  19372817, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.22488 by Cochrane Croatia, Wiley Online Library on [18/06/2025]. For our purposes we used only GPS location data, and the PTT served to transmit GPS locations via the ARGOS satellite network. Consequently, some males marked the previous fall contributed spring migration locations every 5–7 days; these males comprised 25% of the dataset (34 of 133 marked woodcock), and their transmitter batteries generally failed before completion of spring migration (described in greater detail below). The PTT uplink was disrupted >95% of the time when woodcock died and their transmitters came into contact with the ground (Fish 2021); therefore, we assumed all location data were from live woodcock. Data management and the hidden Markov model  We used male woodcock locations collected between 5 January and 15 June, during 2019–2022. Because transmitter program schedules and failure to acquire GPS signals produced data gaps of >1 day between locations, we used the midpoint date between successive GPS locations to delineate approximate arrival and departure dates from each stopover, and departure and arrival dates for the initiation and termination of migration, respectively. We structured an idealized model of migration, with pre-migration, migration, and post-migration states that were distinguished by 2 data streams: step length and turn angle. We removed 3 individuals from the analysis that made transient long-distance movements during pre-migration without also engaging in northward movements that would be consistent with migration; 2 of these birds stopped transmitting data before other birds in the sample had begun migration, whereas a third bird remained resident in southern Florida throughout the breeding season. When woodcock died or their transmitters stopped functioning, we inherently received no further data on continued migration. Our sample size included 34 males marked during fall and 99 males marked during winter that contributed to timing of departure and stopover data; 69 males marked during winter and 5 males marked during fall contributed to timing and location of termination. We summarized the timing of the SGS using the most recent 5 years of survey data (2018–2022) and evaluated how realized survey timing related to migration phenology. We intersected male termination points with this data layer, and tabulated the number of GPS-marked males that ended their migrations either within the SGS coverage or outside of it. Author Manuscript assess this possibility, we visually compared the distribution of stopover duration (in days) recorded during SGS windows with that of all stopovers in the dataset. RESULTS We collected migration data from 133 GPS-marked male woodcock, of which 19 were marked in wintering areas of the Central Management Region, while the remainder (n = 112) were marked in the Eastern Management Region. Double counting has been raised as a concern with SGS data (Moore et al. Of greater concern is the possibility that woodcock population indices derived from SGS data have spatial biases resulting from mischaracterization of migrating males as birds that have established their final breeding territories. For example, if migrating woodcock are counted more frequently in southern regions, SGS data would underestimate population indices farther north, potentially discounting the relative importance of northern areas. (2016) indicating greater southern recruitment (9% of hunter-shot juveniles) than would be expected based on our male migration data (1% of  19372817, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.22488 by Cochrane Croatia, Wiley Online Library on [18/06/2025]. The SGS data are used to estimate annual and long-term trends and evaluate woodcock populations status, within the 2 woodcock management regions and for individual states and provinces (Seamans and Rau 2022). Within our 4-year dataset, there was no evidence of considerable deviations in the timing of each stage of migration among years. 2020), but the consequences to inference from SGS data remain unclear. Additional work using simulations and GPS-tracking data could provide insights in these areas. We focused capture efforts principally (but not exclusively) in the Eastern Woodcock Management Region, and while our dataset spanned 70% of the species’ longitudinal distribution, we acknowledge the migration and final breeding distributions of our marked birds skewed towards the eastern portion of the species’ range as a result. Within our dataset, there was little evidence that wintering or final breeding longitude affected the timing of initiation or completion of migration, suggesting that timing is similar across the species’ range; however, it is likely that a greater proportion of Central Management Region woodcock end migration at more northern latitudes, particularly in northern Minnesota and western Ontario. Author Manuscript One substantial difference between our study and this previous work is that we used data exclusively from male woodcock, whereas Moore et al. Additional data from GPS-marked males migrating in the Central Management Region would be useful to better understand the role of sex and longitude in shaping the range-wide phenology of woodcock spring migration. While we assume most male woodcock actively display throughout the period of migration, data are lacking on the frequency of display during stopovers, or whether this could vary between age classes. If young migrating birds are disproportionally counted during the SGS, it raises the possibility that annual variability or long-term trends in recruitment could change the degree to which migration influences SGS data. Author Manuscript practitioners of the survey and those who rely on SGS data for woodcock management. We recommend that additional research should explore how overlap between migration and survey timing affects inferences from SGS data. We further recommend additional GPS marking of male woodcock in the Central Management Region to complement our data and provide a comprehensive, range-wide assessment of woodcock migration phenology.

LIU ET AL.montane forest ecosystem, but some of the most elevationally restricted are found in the páramo shrub and high elevation grasslands that are found above 3,000 m [13,14,17,19].MethodsWe used program Maxent [21] to predict baseline (2006–2015), and future (2070) species distributions under the four climate change scenarios of the IPCC’s AR5 Greenhouse Gas Concentration Pathways [22].Data sourcesTo predict baseline species distributions, we used data from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s eBird program – a community science database of bird observations compiled from checklists submitted through an online portal [23]. eBird data are verified by both model-based automated filters and a network of voluntary reviewers [23]. This time period was carefully chosen to ensure that sample sizes were sufficient for as many species as possible, while also ensuring that it was as close as possible to the baseline climate data from 1970 to 2000. Because eBird began in 2002, and data submissions were sparse for the first few years, it was not possible to more closely align the bird data and climate data. The Talamanca Hummingbird Eugenes spectabilis was added to the analysis following its split from the Rivoli’s Hummingbird Eugenes fulgens in 2017 [25].Environment data layers included elevation (SRTM DEM [26]), land cover, ecosystem type, and climate. To provide a more nuanced representation of forest types, we also included an ecosystem typing based on the Central American Ecosystems Map from year 2000 [30] reclassified into 18 ecosystem types, based on expert opinion (Appendix 1).We obtained raster layers of monthly climate data from Version 2 of the WorldClim database [31]. Based on previous studies [32–35] we selected seven climate variables for inclusion in the models, representing both temperature and precipitation metrics: BIO1 =  Annual Mean Temperature; BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation × 100); BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month; BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month; BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6); BIO12 = Annual Precipitation; and BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation).Climate data were for a baseline period of 1970 to 2000, and the four future scenarios for the year 2070: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5. Climate data were aligned and downscaled to 90 m × 90 m cells to ensure compatibility with landscape data.Species distribution modelsWe ran Maxent with a regularization multiplier of 2, to avoid overfitting [39]. There are many methods available for classifying probability data into two discrete classes [40]. We overlaid a map of currently protected areas, taken from the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA, November 2019 update [41]), with raster data of the projected species ranges in Program R. From these data we were able to calculate the percentage of range for each species that remained in protected areas under each projected climate outcome [42].ResultsWe found that model fit was excellent for all 48 endemic species analyzed, with a mean AUC of 0.941 (Table 2).

Its population size is thought to be fewer than 10,000 individuals with long-term population declines, and it is classified as Vulnerable by IUCN [47], although this assessment was based on expert opinion in the absence of data. Therefore, the habitat changes and range contractions due to climate change will affect many species beyond the 48 species included in our study, and the implications for genetic diversity of a much wider array of species merits attention.Despite patchy occurrence data, the predicted area of occupancy in 2006–2015 closely matched the species distribution maps of BirdLife International for all of our study species, which reflects the fact that this suite of species is strongly constrained by elevation and climate [17]. This is supported by the very high AUC values of our models, which indicate that predictions made from eBird data have high sensitivity (true negative rate) and high specificity (true negative rate). Our study indicates that this large suite of endemic bird species will undergo range contractions, and likely, concomitant population declines in the future, but for all of them, robust population size and trend data are lacking. The eBird data were geographically biased because there are large tracts of the Talamancan forests that are difficult to access, such as the Caribbean slope of the range. In addition, there was a temporal mismatch between the bird data and our baseline climate data: eBird data were for 2006 to 2015, while the current NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY123climate variables were out-of-date, dating from the period 1970 to 2000. The climate data in the period of 2006–2015 were likely different from those in the period of 1970–2000 since a general warming trend was identified in the region of Central America [57]. However, the predicted future ranges for the majority of endemic species will be inside protected areas, which should help to lessen the likelihood of species extinctions.AcknowledgmentsBird data were provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and are collated from the observations of hundreds of citizen scientists.

050;;;;;;;False;;False;;;[];;"To understand how anthropogenic influences shape avian movements and ecology, we marked 623 wintering blackcaps at 59 sites across Britain and Ireland and compiled a dataset of 9929 encounters. We use ringing recoveries and a detailed dataset of individual captures and resightings to study how individ-ually color-marked birds utilize garden habitats and food resources. We use ringing data to study movements within and across winters, and we combine ringing with K E Y W O R D Sanimal movement ecology, annual cycle, anthropogenic effects, bird migration, carry-over, climatic effects, foraging, site fidelity, supplemental feeding 13652486, 2021, 12, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15597 by Cochrane Croatia, Wiley Online Library on [18/06/2025]. We provided observers with data sheets and asked them to record all sightings of marked blackcaps. We considered blackcaps to be confidently categorized as wintering individuals (as op-posed to early or late migrants passing through) if they were encoun-tered between 1 December and 1 March, defining these boundaries using ringing recovery data (Figure S1). In total, we com-piled a dataset of 9929 records of 623 color-ringed blackcaps, of which 357 were encountered one or more times after initial capture.2.2  |  MorphometricsWe measured blackcaps during ringing using wing and tail rules and analog calipers. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License2718 |   VAN DOREN et al.2.3  |  Daily weatherWe obtained local weather station data from the Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS; Met Office, 2012; http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/220a65615218d5c9cc9e4785a3234bd0). We in-cluded only data from individuals categorized as wintering in Britain (see above). For analysis, we retained data from a given site in a given winter if there were blackcap observations from at least 30 days in that winter. We simplified the model by removing non-significant interactions (p > 0.05).Our dataset comprised daily encounters compiled from dozens of observers, but we lacked observation effort data with which to infer zero counts for days with no marked birds reported. Therefore, our count dataset lacked zero counts, which are expected with a Poisson distribution family. We leveraged our extensive dataset of individual observations to model the probability of individual blackcaps visiting garden feeding sites through the winter. In total, the dataset had 6104 positive observations and 10,982 inferred negative observations.First, we used a generalized mixed-effects model with a bino-mial distribution and logit link function to model the probability of an individual being detected in a garden on a particular day. We fit the model with bam (a version of gam for large datasets). We spec-ified random effects of year, location, and individual to account for differences in the average probability of blackcap detection across years, sites, and individuals.We next focused on testing for relationships between garden visitation and morphology and body condition, restricting the anal-ysis to data from individuals that had been captured and measured at least once during the winter of observation. This reduced our dataset from 6104 positive observations of 225 individuals to 2777 positive observations of 90 individuals. For each individual, we determined whether or not it subsequently returned to the same site, consider-ing data from up to three winters following initial ringing. We only retained data points for sites where we had visual observation data for subsequent winters (N  =  324 individuals across 17 sites). We also included a fixed effect describing the number of years of observa-tion data available to account for differences in the number of re-sighting opportunities. As above, we used the rptR package.2.7  |  TransienceOur dataset included a large number of blackcaps that were encoun-tered only briefly each year. We modeled the likelihood of transience in our dataset with a binary variable of whether each individual bird was encountered for more than 1 week in a year. We obtained ringing data from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Ringing Scheme for Britain and Ireland. For resight data, we categorized blackcaps as British Isles winterers if they were encountered between 1 December and 1 March (Figure S1).Given the evidence for transient individuals among wintering blackcaps visiting gardens, we used ringing data to study move-ments undertaken by individuals within the same winter. We fil-tered ringing data to individuals we were confident were wintering in Britain and Ireland (see above), but we considered all recoveries between 1 November and 1 April to understand how these in-dividuals moved both early and late in the season. We also used ringing data to examine movements between winters, filtering the dataset to encounters that occurred between 1 December and 1 March.We combined ringing data with tracks from light-level geoloca-tors (Figure 1c) to identify where blackcaps wintering in Britain and Ireland spend the summer. Geolocator data were from Delmore et al. Unsurprisingly, individual identity explained more vari-ation in the dataset (0.13, 95% CI [0.08, 0.16]) than location (0.05 [0, 0.12]) or year (0.04 [0.02, 0.07]).We documented relationships between garden visitation rate and sex, body condition, morphology, and weather. Our first model, which incorporated all individuals but lacked body con-dition and morphology data, revealed strong relationships with air temperature, precipitation, and winds.

Ringing data showed that between-winter movements averaged 148 km ± 309 SD (Figure 4b). Our detailed garden sight-ing data showed that even individuals established in a garden in one winter may spend the following winter far from the initial site. The following winter, it did not return to this site, but was present (and pho-tographed) at a garden 53 km away between 7 January and 12 February 2019.3.6  |  Breeding areas and migrationCombining ringing recoveries and geolocator data, we observe that blackcaps wintering in Britain and Ireland occupy a wide breeding area, spanning 2000 km across Europe (Figure 4d). Circles show ringing recoveries and crosses show geolocator data from Delmore et al. An ad-ditional six recoveries occurred within Britain and Ireland, suggesting some individuals may be year-round residents (though see Section 4).Geolocator data indicated that British winterers departed on spring migration between 15 March and 26 April, with a median date of 2 April (Figure 5a). Truly harsh weather events (e.g., with snow cover or pro-longed freezing conditions) were rare in our dataset. In addition, 79.8% of our analyzed data come from the gardens of authors GCMR and GCE, who provided a constant food supply. (2007), as their data came from captures and ours pri-marily from visual resightings with variable effort; future work on blackcap garden behavior would benefit from more standardized observation effort and individual tracking data (e.g., via radio telem-etry). Thus, garden feeding stations may have a disproportion-ate positive effect on survival.4.4  |  Individual variation and flexibilityLarge individual variation was a defining feature of our dataset. Regardless, our results show that black-caps exhibit a great deal of variation and flexibility in their strate-gies, which may be a key to their success as environments rapidly change.4.5  |  Breeding origins of British winterers and evidence for residencyWe combined ringing recoveries and individual tracking data to show that blackcaps wintering in Britain originate from a 2000 km wide swath of Europe (Delmore et al., 2020). Ringing recoveries alone supported central European origins of the wintering popula-tion, but tracking data show that the breeding range extends well into southwest Europe, even to the Iberian Peninsula, and farther east than suggested from ringing recoveries.There were six recoveries of individuals encountered in Britain and Ireland during both summer and winter, suggesting limited year-round residency. Moreover, our individual-level data reveal the tremendous individual flexibility that blackcaps exhibit in their movement patterns and responses to conditions.

Four urban areas in Switzerland were chosen for the analyses,Zürich, Basel, Lausanne and Fribourg, and we analyzed the changes in aquatic plantdiversity based on the historical and recent floristic data available for the same areas andthe same time periods. To counteract these adverseeffects of urbanization and to ensure that urban expansion proceeds in a sustainable manner,further ecological data need to be collected. Using the available literature, we generateda databank that included all native aquatic plants of Switzerland and recorded the presence orabsence of all 104 studied taxa for two time periods: (1) the end of the 19th century to thebeginning of the 20th century and (2) the end of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21stcentury.

In addi-tion to data on species distribution and biodiversity (dis-tributionatlasesandsimilarsources),governmentalagricultural statistics allow us to estimate the intensity offarming, and there are now ecological data bases (e.g.Kattge et al. 2011) that provide the traits necessary toidentifyecologicalspecialization,atleastforplants.Here, we assess the potential advantages of the novelapproach of integrating agricultural statistics, biodiversitydata and functional traits relating to ecosystem processesinto analyses of the effectiveness of conservation initia-tives. Secondly, we define protocols forspecies selection and identify appropriate sources of data on spe-cies status and distribution. We are, there-fore, largely dependent upon plant data to link flora and fauna.The simplest approach would be to treat butterfly food plants asdirect predictors of rarity, but we have instead used them toassess habitat fertility and canopy height within butterfly habi-tats.

These data strongly support anexpansion of a subset of the northeast Siberia populationinto North America via Beringia, with all modern NorthAmerican wapiti being the result of that colonization. canadensis.To reconstruct the demographic history of the Beringianwapiti population and its North American descendants, wegenerated a BSP [41] using a dataset comprising finite-dated and modern northeast Siberian and North Americanindividuals (n 1⁄4 30 ancient and 14 modern). It is clear that ecological con-ditionsforwapitiwerepresentinnortheastSiberiathroughout this time.Our data strongly suggest that central Beringia (the Beringisthmus proper) was a barrier that prevented wapiti (andmoose) from crossing to Alaska for much of MIS 3–2. Based on pollen and beetledata [56,59], a significant environmental shift occurred in thecentral Bering Strait region around 17–18 ka, from birch grami-noid to birch–heath–graminoid tundra. The increased forage productivityfor browsers and mixed feeders expected as a result of warm-ing apparently provided the conditions suitable for these taxa.(b) Human colonization of the New WorldOur three-stage model of trans-Beringian migration for wapitiresembles a model derived from genetic data for humancolonization of North America [4,7,60]. The presence of wapiti, a currently temperate–borealtaxon, in northeast Siberia through periods of environmentalchange during MIS 3 and MIS 2, supports the notion that con-ditions were amenable for other species of flexible adaptationbut not generally considered to be Arctic-adapted, such ashumans.Significantly, our data suggest that the timing of humanmigration across the land bridge was subject to the same con-ditions that determined that timing in other species. Their increasing importance as a prey item after14 ka may relate to the extinction of horse and mammoth (seethe electronic supplementary material, table S5).More persuasively, a model emerges from our data thatthe migration was blocked by a sea barrier until 70 ka andinappropriate conditions on the intermittent isthmus during70–15 ka. Although additional data onarchaeological sites on either side of the Bering Strait will con-tinue to be difficult to obtain, end-Pleistocene faunal migrationhistories should be more straightforward to infer.
